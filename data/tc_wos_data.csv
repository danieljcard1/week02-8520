J,"Britt, BC; Britt, RK","Britt, Brian C.; Britt, Rebecca K.",,,The Roles of Medium and Narrative Believability in Guided Mobile Tour Navigation,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: This study investigates the role of need for cognition and narrative believability when using a mobile device to take a guided tour of a new location, informing future research and practice in both narrative design and media ecology. Method: Experiment participants (n = 141) toured a new research facility using one of three combinations of navigation aids (a smartphone only, a brochure and a smartphone, or a brochure only) as a guide. An ordinal regression analysis and multivariate regression analysis were used to assess the relationships among navigation aids, narrative believability, need for cognition, and perceived ease of navigation. Results: Use of a smartphone only or a brochure in tandem with a smartphone were positively related to evaluations of the narrative as highly consistent as well as perceptions that the narrative offered a high degree of coverage. However, using a brochure in tandem with a smartphone was negatively related to perceived ease of navigation, while narrative plausibility had a positive effect on perceived ease of navigation. Conclusion: This study illustrates how different mobile devices result in a range of interpretations of the same materials and, ultimately, different levels of success in real -world navigation. Even a simple narrative can aid wayfinding if users find it sufficiently plausible. More broadly, the results suggest the need for research to facilitate the development of more engaging multimedia tour guides.",,,,,,,,,,,82,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2021,68,3,,,,,76,96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: This article utilizes memetic rhetorical analysis to identify interface- and content-specific memes and to explore the connections between those memes that create environments to which some adapt successfully while other are lost. Results: My analysis shows that the interface memes that characterize the Whole30 Facebook Community page create a communicative situation in which personal experience is more likely to be persuasive than scientific research or institutionally conferred credentials.

J,"Colton, JS; Edenfield, AC; Holmes, S","Colton, Jared S.; Edenfield, Avery C.; Holmes, Steve",,,Workplace Democracy and the Problem of Equality,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Professional communicators are becoming more invested in unique configurations of power in organizations, including non-hierarchical and democratic workplaces. While organizations dedicated to democratic processes may enact power differently than conventional organizations, they may fall short of practicing equality. This article explains the differences in non-hierarchical workplaces, considers businesses where democracy is a goal, and argues for considering equality as a habitual practice, particularly when writing regulatory documents. Method: We conduct a review of the literature on non-hierarchical workplaces and organizational democracy, applying Jacques Ranciere's concept of equality to two examples (one using primary data collection and one using secondary data) of two cooperatives where organizational democracy is integral to the design of the business. Results: The literature review exposes an interest in metis (cunning, craftiness, flexibility) as vital to practitioner success in non-hierarchical workplaces; however, this article demonstrates that metis does not prevent inequality, even in organizations expressly committed to workplace democracy. Conclusion: Professional communicators need to consider equality not solely as a structural resource (as in rules, laws, policies) but as a habitual practice to cultivate alongside other characteristics and frameworks important to a professional communicator's toolkit.",,,,,,,,,,,73,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2019,66,1,,,,,53,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Chong, F","Chong, Felicia",,,YouTube Beauty Tutorials as Technical Communication,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: With the increasing popularity of YouTube beauty videos, this study extends previous research on YouTube instructional videos by investigating the common characteristics of the 10 most-reviewed makeup and hair tutorials to determine their similarity to or differences from good instructional videos. Method: Using a deductive coding method, I analyzed the 10 most-viewed beauty tutorials based on Swarts' (2012) best practices for creating instructional videos and Mackiewicz's (2010) assertion categories of expertise. Results: A majority of the videos followed best practices, such as including an introduction, beginning with a promise or a clear objective, incorporating verbal instruction, being strategically redundant, and using a combination of text annotations, audio, and/or still images to complement the video. However, a lack of confidence and quality in most of the videos suggest that the creators did not rehearse their scripts, nor did they use the recording and editing tools effectively. None of the creators seems to provide any reassurance to the viewers or promote a sense of their self-efficacy. In terms of asserting their credibility, the majority of the creators did not make any explicit assertions about their relevant role, product-specific experience, or familiarity with related and relevant products. Conclusion: Although best practices, such as having a clear objective and using verbal instructions, should be followed, instructional video designers should also consider additional factors, such as truthfulness and accuracy, accessibility, kairos, addressivity, personal narratives, and humor.",,,,,,,,,,,46,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2018,65,3,,,,,293,308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Boettger, RK","Boettger, Ryan K.",,,The Technical Communication Editing Test: Three Studies on This Assessment Type,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: In this paper, I present the results of three studies on editing tests used to screen prospective technical communicators and the error types common to these tests. Because few publically available, authentic examples exist, I first explore the general characteristics of 55 tests and 71 error types. Error types are correlated against 176 professionals' perceptions of these error types. Method: The sample's characteristics were first identified from the tests and the hiring managers. Three raters then independently classified the errors types using coding schemas from previous taxonomies of college-level writing. Finally, a 24-question survey was administered to capture professional communicators' perceptions of error. Results: Editing tests were typically designed in narrative format and evaluated holistically, but variation in administration and format existed. The sample included 3,568 errors and 71 error types. Errors related to wrong words, spelling, and capitalization dominated, but 13 other errors were frequently found as well as dispersed within at least 50% of the sample. Conversely, professionals were bothered most by apostrophe errors, homonyms, and sentence fragments. No significant correlations were found among the frequencies and dispersions of the editing tests' errors and the professionals' perceptions of those errors. Conclusions: Editing tests share common characteristics, but organizational context substantially influences its format and contents. There were consistencies between the editing test error types and types identified in college-writing taxonomies; however, context again influences why errors are introduced as well as the types of errors that were identified. Finally, hiring managers and professionals share different perceptions of error. Understanding these differences can produce better assessment tools and better prepare test takers.",,,,,,,,,,,30,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2014,61,4,,,,,215,231,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In embracing a storytelling approach and Black Feminist epistemology, we explore the limits of traditional heuristics, illustrating the need to couple storytelling and lived experience with heuristic frameworks. Method: This study employs a qualitative, narrative inquiry methodology and semi structured interview data collection approaches. Results: Two elements of Walton, Moore, and Jones' (2019) 4Rs heuristic were expanded upon and further articulated through participant stories. To help people develop the ability to recognize injustice, data identified three sources for building expertise: lived experience, reading and proximity to lived experience, and accumulation within and across experiences. Revealing injustices occurred through both planned, often written, responses and in-the-moment responses.

Method: Using a qualitative case study methodology, this research examined Linkedln's public user profiles. One case study participant was selected, whose profile met the criteria of promoting personal branding via multiple media artifacts, using transmedia storytelling techniques, and networking inside a participatory social media culture. Results: In this case study, the participant, Jacobs, used multimodal composing and transmedia storytelling techniques on Linkedln's social media site. Sharing smaller narratives across different media, Jacobs invites participation from his followers as well as responses from him to his followers. Within this participatory culture, his posts often blur personal and professional topics of interest but still remain singularly focused on promoting his personal branding to a wider audience Conclusion: Young professionals are not turning to traditional resources for advice on how to establish personal branding. Instead, they are turning to a networked, social world and using multiple media and transmedia storytelling techniques to attract followers, connect to other professionals, and network with potential employers.",,,,,,,,,,,34,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2019,66,3,,,,,230,243,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Mueller, D","Mueller, David",,,The Transmedia Workbench: Technical Communication and User-Driven Innovation,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Emergent cultural and technological developments are actively involving users not just in how technology is understood and utilized but also in how it is produced and what its capabilities might be. From the perspective of technical communication, this direct involvement is enacted across networks of participatory media artifacts: webpages, user forums, tutorial videos, images, and open source software. In this article, I discuss how these transmedia networks support user-driven innovation and what roles technical communicators might play in creating, curating, and maintaining them. As a case study of a transmedia network, I examine the Werkstatt Workshop, the online user portal supporting Moog's Werkstatt synthesizer. Method: My case study employs discourse analytic techniques to show how the language of the Werkstatt Workshop is both descriptive and constitutive of an emergent social practice. To theorize roles for technical communicators, I draw on previous studies of user forums, open source software, and tactical technical communication. Results: Discourses circulating within the Werkstatt Workshop go beyond simply documenting system processes to construct a world in which network participants enact identities, form relationships, and reconfigure information across media boundaries. The open, participatory orientation of the network incentivizes information sharing and innovation, as users organize knowledge resources around a common set of technological problems. Conclusion: Emerging cultures of making and modifying present opportunities to technical communicators as content creators, network administrators, and critics, helping to construct, optimize, and seriously understand new, productive knowledge networks supporting user-centered production and innovation.",,,,,,,,,,,21,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2019,66,3,,,,,244,256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Evia, C; Priestley, M","Evia, Carlos; Priestley, Michael",,,Structured Authoring without XML: Evaluating Lightweight DITA for Technical Documentation,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: We present a proposal for HDITA, an HTML5-based version of the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). We report on an exploratory study about the feasibility of using HDITA as an authoring platform for technical content. We asked how novice technical writers describe and evaluate the complexity and difficulty of the different stages of the HDITA authoring process and if novice technical writers can author effective topic-based technical content in HTML5 (HDITA) without full knowledge of XML (DITA). Method: To evaluate the feasibility of authoring and publishing with HDITA, we modified the Instructions assignment of an introductory college course called Technical Writing. Students wrote blog posts during the authoring process and completed a survey on the perceived difficulty of HDITA. We evaluated the quality of HDITA Web deliverables with college students from diverse technical and academic backgrounds. Results: Most author students were somewhat confident authoring technical content with HDITA, and most said they were very likely to somewhat likely to use HDITA in the future for technical writing projects. Students reported that the most difficult part of using HDITA involved Web templates and not HDITA itself. Twenty-seven students evaluated HDITA deliverables and gave them positive scores using a rubric for assessing quality technical information. Conclusion: Acknowledging the small number of student authors involved in this feasibility study, we can still conclude that novice technical writers did not perceive creating technical documentation with HDITA as difficult or highly complex. Most student evaluators were able to complete the assigned tasks following the instructions created in HDITA.",,,,,,,,,,,34,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2016,63,1,,,,,23,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Integrated Technical Content,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: To examine the attitudes and perspectives of individuals in successful companies who manage technical communicators with a specific focus on the products and processes that make up the bulk of their work. Method: This study used a modified Delphi method. To gather data, we used two sets of survey questions and two structured interviews. Results: This research helped to further explain the relationship between what technical communicators produce and how these products function in situating or framing their producers in relation to other subfields/related disciplines, such as UX design, information design, knowledge management, usability, and information architecture. Conclusion: While there is general agreement among the managers that the role of the technical communicator has to expand, there is no one clear agreed-upon strategy. Some companies are obtaining success using Agile methodology, while others are finding that this methodology, while stressing adaptability, is not easy to introduce. Corporate cultures do not change overnight. Still, integrated teams, a key component of Agile, are taking hold in most cultures. Equally important, the shift away from writing documents to directing content is well underway. The key now, as it has been for decades, is for technical communicators to highlight their value and make their contributions more visible.",,,,,,,,,,,38,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2015,62,2,,,,,118,134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Carliner, S","Carliner, Saul",,,The Three Approaches to Professionalization in Technical Communication,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Explores internal divisions within our profession by exploring one particular type of tension: that technical communicators do not have a unified view of professionalization for the field. Method: Proposes that prevailing approaches to professionalization are rooted in theories of occupations, the exclusive right to perform a job. True occupations have such rights legally; aspiring occupations like ours are disciplines. Common components of an infrastructure for occupations include professional organizations, bodies of knowledge, education, professional activities, and certification. Results: Disciplines often establish these in anticipation of becoming an occupation, but some practicing professionals interpret and use them differently, resulting in a spectrum of approaches to professionalization. At one end of the spectrum is formal professionalism, which views professionalization as a stepping stone to full occupational status. It is rooted in a worldview that values expertise and sees the infrastructure of an occupation supporting the development of expertise and controlling access to the profession. In the center of the spectrum is quasiprofessionalization, in which individuals participate in the activities of the occupational infrastructure but without the expectation of exclusive rights to perform the work. Quasiprofessionalization is rooted in professional identity. At the other end of the spectrum is contraprofessionalization, which refers to initiatives that offer or promote professional services outside of parts of or the entire infrastructure, sometimes circumventing it completely. This world view is rooted in market theory and characterized by concepts like do-it-yourself (DIY), user-generated, and subject matter expert (SME)-provided documentation. Conclusions: The differing views suggest tensions regarding support for specific efforts to professionalize technical communication, including formal branding of the profession, establishment of certification, and support for professional organizations.",,,,,,,,,,,45,17,17,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2012,59,1,,,,,49,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study investigates whether color as a Web site element can serve as a trustworthiness cue. In addition, the context of these Web sites was taken into account as research indicates that emotions associated with colors might differ between contexts. Method: An experimental study was conducted in which first impressions of trustworthiness of Web sites were measured in relation with the chosen color scheme. More than 200 participants evaluated eight finance, eight legal, and eight medical Web sites on perceived trustworthiness. Each respondent was presented with an identical Web site that only differed on the used color scheme. Four different color schemes (red, blue, green, and black) were put to the test. Result: The findings indicate that when the same Web site is presented using different color schemes, the Web sites are considered to have different levels of trustworthiness. Color has a statistically significant but limited effect, compared with all other reasons people can have to trust a Web site. Overall, the blue color scheme was perceived as most trustworthy and black as least trustworthy. The effect of the context is statistically significant, but very small. Conclusion: The color-trustworthiness relationship has never been demonstrated in the context of Web sites. This study supports the common sense idea with scientific evidence by showing that color matters in a user's judgment of a Web site's trustworthiness. Web site designers can increase the trustworthiness of a Web site by using an appropriate color scheme.",,,,,,,,,,,26,22,22,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2011,58,2,,,,,149,160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While component content management (CCM) is committed to both cost reduction and quality improvement, it also presents several challenges to multilingual quality. In this article, I present approaches for constructing multilingual quality as a global TC metric. Method: This article relies on the results of two surveys, one conducted through technical communication venues and one through technical translation venues. Results: The surveys identified contradictions in the beliefs and practices of multilingual quality in CCM environments that led to problems with multilingual quality. I group the contradictions and problems with the help of the activity theory lens and, based on this grouping, present questions that global technical communication project teams can ask themselves to improve their work practices. Conclusions: Effective communication between stakeholders and the knowledge of end-users are the two prerequisites to creating high-quality multilingual information products in CCM environments. Approaches to multilingual quality need to be collaborative and highly contextualized-dependent on business goals, user needs, and available resources.

J,"Mackiewicz, J","Mackiewicz, Jo",,,Quality in Product Reviews: What Technical Communicators Should Know,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Measuring the quality of product reviews via helpfulness votes is problematic for several reasons. I delineate the components of product review quality in order to assist technical communicators who manage their organizations' user-generated content in identifying quality content and in helping reviewers produce quality content. Method/Corpus: I analyze results from secondary research on product reviews and discuss six important components of review quality. I focus most attention on five components of review quality that technical communicators can assess-informativeness, valance, credibility, conformity, and readability-and briefly describe a sixth component-user characteristics. I also exemplify these components, drawing from a corpus of 8,973 product reviews gathered in 2013 from a variety of retail and review websites. Results: Based on this analysis, I recommend strategies that technical communicators can use (1) to identify these components of review quality, (2) to develop a rich data set from which they can glean consumer wants and needs as well as trends related to their organizations' products, and (3) to help reviewers write better reviews. Conclusions: As the amount of user-generated content grows, the need to learn from it and the need to improve it grow. By using their knowledge and skills in new ways, technical communicators who manage and develop product reviews can stay relevant and necessary as organizations rely more and more heavily on user-generated content.",,,,,,,,,,,52,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2015,62,1,,,,,3,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: To develop a sustainable content strategy for the body of knowledge project, informed by content analysis, user generated survey data, and benchmarked trends from other knowledge bases. Results: An important part of content strategy for a large-scale knowledge base, such as the TCBOK, involves innovating practices with regard to the information taxonomy, tools, content assets, and information development standards, as the product and user base matures. Successful technical communication knowledge bases employ taxonomies with higher level topics that represent specific disciplines and sub-disciplines within technical communication. Integrating the human user into content strategy involves a complex interplay of user expectation and feasible decision making. Conclusions: Developing a body of knowledge, particularly over time, may require an integrated or hybrid approach to content strategy, involving a complex set of factors that include the human user, content assets, and sustainable practices.

This family of tools includes wikis, online word processors, learning management systems (LMSs), and other collaborative tools. The data gathered were used to illustrate these tools' value to practitioners, as well as provide educators with recommendations about which tools to teach students. Method: Surveys were deployed to technical communication practitioners and students; each group had its own survey. The surveys gathered quantitative and qualitative data. The qualitative data were analyzed through a coding system. Results: Roughly 85% of both groups used OCWTs; however, practitioners used them daily while students used them only weekly. Practitioners primarily used tools chosen by their companies, and their most-used tools were Microsoft SharePoint, Google Docs, and company intranet. Students were features driven, and their most-used tools were Google Docs, PBWorks (formerly PBWiki), and Blackboard. Both groups had positive opinions overall about OCWTs. Conclusion: Technical communication practitioners appear to be using these tools often in the workplace, and several OCWTs appear to have become standards. These tools seem to hold value for practitioners, who use them for a wide variety of collaborative tasks. Technical communication students and educators should be aware of the OCWTs and collaborative tasks found in industry so that students can learn them. These tools include wikis, online word processors, and SharePoint (or something similar, such as an LMS). Finally, some tasks that practitioners perform (single sourcing, project management, and so forth) appear unfamiliar to students-it would be beneficial if students learned to perform these tasks in the classroom.",,,,,,,,,,,12,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2013,60,1,,,,,28,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: The course, titled Tiny Houses and Technical Writing partnered with a local 501(c)3 non-profit organization, Tiny House Community Development (THCD), which builds free tiny homes and offers construction-based career training programs for those experiencing homelessness. We used several techniques to elevate our community partner's narrative and highlight local issues of homelessness, utilizing storytelling and personas as methods to provide human-centered designs. We also employed technical communication's emphases on optimal format, arrangement, and style to revise and build documents. The course engaged in project-based service by producing various technical documents as well as providing direct service building tiny homes; this work was often completed alongside clients the THCD organization serves. Ultimately, we aimed to engage the stories of those the organization serves and reflect those stories within the deliverables. Results: The students in this course ultimately helped THCD streamline communications, increase build productivity, and communicate its mission to the local community. Additionally, the organization used several of our documents in a grant competition and ultimately won $12,000 in future funding. We believe the storytelling element present in the technical documents elevated these communications. The course also sparked several new collaborations, conversations, and publications, thus propelling the organization's stories-and its human elements-into the larger community. Conclusion: Tiny Houses and Technical Writing serves as an example of a community partnership model for undergraduate introductory technical writing courses and tiny house building groups.",,,,,,,,,,,29,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,68,4,,,,,88,101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Shirley, BJ","Shirley, Beth J.",,,Post-Fact Fact Sheets: Dissociative Framing as a Strategy to Work Past Climate Change Denial,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: This article presents a new rhetorical model for science and technical communication-specifically climate change communication-which the author is calling dissociative framing, in which climate change can be dissociated from the behaviors necessary to mitigate the human contribution to climate change, while positive associations are formed with those behaviors. This model serves as an alternative to the knowledge deficit model still in use in much science communication and is applicable both for students and practitioners of technical communication. Method: The model was developed by examining Matthew Nisbet's work on framing in conjunction with Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca's work on dissociation. I conducted a coded rhetorical analysis of two fact sheets produced by the Utah State University Extension Office with information on how their audience can change personal behaviors to mitigate their personal impact on climate change. I suggest how a dissociative frame would present the information more effectively. Results: A dissociative framing model can provide practitioners in technical and professional communication (TPC) a way to work around science skepticism and motivate action, especially when working with short, community-based genres, and can provide teachers of technical communication with a heuristic for instructing students on how to best engage a skeptical audience. Conclusion: While rural communities in the United States are especially prone to climate skepticism, it is important that they be informed and empowered to make the necessary behavioral changes to mitigate the human impact on climate change. Fact sheets published by extension services provide an excellent opportunity to inform and empower. A dissociative framing model provides a clear way to empower these communities with knowledge of how to mitigate their impact on climate change without diving into the political issues embroiled in climate science.",,,,,,,,,,,56,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021,68,2,,,,,41,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article explains our content landscape, the rationale behind the development of a new visual method to represent that landscape, and the resulting analysis to support an overall content strategy. Method: We present a technique that we used to analyze our complex content ecosystem of technical content and our approach to develop a consistent content strategy across documentation sets for diverse, yet interrelated products. We analyzed approaches that describe content strategy tools and processes for websites and for content reuse at the topic level, but found those lacking in support for complex technical content. Using that background, we designed our own tool and processes to support content analysis and strategy at the publication level. We developed the concept of a deliverable map, a visual representation of our content landscape by product category. The deliverable map became a highly effective tool in our efforts to define, communicate, and sustain our content strategy. Results: Multiple deliverable maps show existing content and relationships, and provide opportunities for different levels of analysis and stakeholder engagement. This analysis supports development and maintenance of a content strategy that meets business goals and that drives content across multiple outputs. The deliverable maps communicate current state, show the evolution of deliverables, identify content issues, and guide future planning. Conclusion: While the content in a content strategy initiative is typically thought of as small topics or webpages, it can be traditional publications also, such as technical manuals. Established content strategy practices can be adapted and successfully applied to content at all levels of granularity to meet the unique requirements of the organization. Spreadsheets are often the primary tool for documenting current-state content and planning future strategy. However, replacing spreadsheets with visual maps can be a more effective approach for complex, interrelated content landscapes. The interactive map becomes an invaluable tool to help create, communicate, and sustain a cohesive content strategy.",,,,,,,,,,,6,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2019,66,2,,,,,147,162,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our study explores workplace genre conventions in light of responses. Method: Using a grounded theory approach, we gathered data in two stages using a mixed-methods design of interviews and questionnaires. Results: Seventy-three percent of respondents indicated that their respective companies require greater than three quarters of salaried employees to produce formal workplace writing. Further, most respondents (92%) affirmed that prospective professional/salaried employees are almost always adversely affected by poorly written materials. Respondents defined poor writing in prospective and new hires in a variety of ways. All respondents chose Email as a daily genre of writing that eclipses the popularity of any other genre. Applicants and new hires were perceived negatively if formal written email skills were absent. Conclusion: New hires' genre convention mistakes are interpreted as lack of training or skill, or knowledge errors. We posit that novices must adapt to the company writing culture, learning the communicative threshold concepts as they would other aspects of company culture. We posit email has a new, descriptive grammar, altogether-a set of rules deployed in individual workplaces that may not carry over to the next employer. So, we propose that email be taught and recognized in workplaces as what we have termed a chameleon genre, a genre that does whatever its users want it to do.",,,,,,,,,,,59,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2019,66,1,,,,,68,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The historical case of Port Chicago-a failed relationship of a military facility and its neighboring civilian community-offers important lessons regarding the nefarious practice of erasive rhetoric and the missed opportunities for cultivating cooperation and communication. Method: A critical review of historical records and pertinent communications from military and civilian sources uncovers a series of rhetorical practices damaging to the safety, identity, and vitality of a community. Results: The language practices of name-changing, dismissive and derogatory descriptions, passive voice, negative claims, tactical omissions, and elaborate pejorative detail, separately and collectively, serve to fortify the source of danger while erasing the object of danger.

Little research has focused on stylistic aspects of text associated with successful campaigns. Method: We used corpus analysis to analyze the text of 312,529 Kickstarter campaigns. We used a novel scoring method to compute how often verbs and words surrounding verbs were associated with success or failure. We then identified prominent stylistic aspects of text that were often included in successful and unsuccessful campaigns. Results: Stylistic elements strongly associated with success included using we instead of I, using contractions instead of full forms of verbs, inviting the reader to join the project and receive rewards, and projecting confidence via will instead of the more uncertain would. Conclusion: Stylistic findings interact. Specifically, using we and contractions together indicates outcomes strongly associated with success. Broadly, each of the findings point toward creators of campaigns attempting to build trust in the readers.

In this article, we identify tactical organizing in online spaces as a complex convergence of social uptake and socialized information afforded by news sharing and mass user interactions in digital platforms.Methods: We employed a case study methodology that combined positivist and interpretive perspectives toward a developing event. We curated a series of Reddit posts pertaining to the WSB-GME saga and applied critical discourse analysis with a focus on the tactical and multimodal elements in these posts to identify their professional and theoretical implications.Results: We found the networked social mania to be driven by a discourse founded on a common goal and a shared leadership that emerges from vertical and horizontal community building. While technology assumes an agentive role in facilitating tactical efforts, it can also create an information bubble, where users may be gripped by a cult -like devotion for their heroes and desire to be part of the latest trends, thereby making risky financial bets.Conclusion: The WSB-GME saga illustrated implications for tactical technical communication as well as the impact of networked interactions on democratization of information, consumer engagement, and the rhetoric of finance.",,,,,,,,,,,68,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2022,69,2,,,,,36,57,,10.55177/tc321987,http://dx.doi.org/10.55177/tc321987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: We performed a literature review of texts published in the last 25 years, identified by searching for the keywords creativity and beauty in technical communication journals, to understand how these concepts have been theorized and included in the field recently. We then extended this prior literature to consider how beauty and creativity might be incorporated into technical communication teaching/training. The suggestions offered are grounded in experiences, observations, and student feedback from our own classrooms and training, and/or from other classroom studies and additional literature from the field. Results: We identified creative approaches that help students and practitioners think more intentionally about audience, purpose, and visual elements in technical communication. These approaches reinforce (rather than distract from) established principles of technical communication. We offer practical solutions for instructors and trainers who are intrigued by more creative techniques but may, for various reasons, consider artistic elements inappropriate or unworkable in their classrooms. Conclusion: Fostering an appreciation for creative and beautiful communication in the classroom helps develop more effective technical communicators. Especially considering that the ways audiences encounter and interact with information have been changing rapidly, technical communicators must be able to think and create both visually and spatially, as well as connect with users on a human level.",,,,,,,,,,,49,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2020,67,4,,,,,28,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Kostelnick, C","Kostelnick, Charles",,,The Art of Visual Design: The Rhetoric of Aesthetics in Technical Communication,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: By recognizing the importance of aesthetics, which have infused technical communication for centuries, designers can more effectively meet audience expectations and achieve key rhetorical goals, including heightening audience engagement, arousing emotion, and enhancing credibility and persuasiveness. Designers can integrate aesthetics into technical communications by deploying visual conventions generated by larger cultural forces, by applying design principles that foster beauty, and by inventing novel forms. Methods: Aesthetic theory, both ancient and modern, and insights from practitioners create a foundation for defining beauty; research and usability studies examining audience preferences provide empirical evidence about the functional value of aesthetics; and aesthetic developments in the nineteenth century and the subsequent shift to Modernism serve to illustrate the cultural influences on design. The Design Methods Movement affords a springboard for exploring the design process and the nature of creativity. Results: Although theorists and practitioners hold conflicting views on the role of aesthetics in functional design, many consider it an important factor that makes designs attractive and engaging to audiences. The pursuit of beauty continues today through the application of culturally based conventions and design principles associated with beauty. Conclusion: The cultural knowledge embedded in visual aesthetics operates silently, even imperceptibly, as technical communicators deploy aesthetic conventions to meet audience expectations and to streamline their design processes. At the same time, technical communicators need leeway for creativity and novelty as they adapt visual elements to specific rhetorical situations, often seeking audience feedback about their aesthetic preferences to create engaging, persuasive, and usable designs.",,,,,,,,,,,95,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2020,67,4,,,,,6,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This has led to a number of social media foibles that can create a public relations nightmare for the affected companies. This article will explore the emerging phenomenon of the corporate Twitter apology and the rhetorical constructs that are required for an effective apology. Method: Using the strategies of Ruth Page and John Kador, I have analyzed successful and unsuccessful Twitter apologies. The success of these apologies is determined by the public response from the tertiary audiences comprised of Twitter followers. Results: This study determined that successful Twitter apologies use a combination of Kador's strategies (Recognition, Responsibility, Remorse, Restitution, and Repetition), originally implemented for analog apologies, adapted for electronic communications to make a successful social media apology. Conclusion: Surviving any serious social media foible depends upon issuing a successful apology and doing so on the social media platform where the original offense took place.

J,"Edenfield, AC","Edenfield, Avery C.",,,The Burden of Ambiguity: Writing at a Cooperative,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: While many organizations use ambiguity to strategically build a unified diversity around an organization's mission, democratically managed organizations need to tread a narrow path between necessary ambiguity (which allows flexibility) and dysfunctional ambiguity (which causes disarray). To illustrate, I report a subset of findings regarding occasions when ambiguous documents had a significant impact on a democratically managed organization. Methods: I conducted a three-phase study of a democratic cooperative. Using a mixed-methods approach, I sought to uncover the ways technical and professional communication (TPC) concerns like ambiguity and clarity function in a democratic business. In my analysis, I looked for patterns and dissonance between/among artifacts and participants, paying special attention to areas of ambiguity. Interviews and transcripts were analyzed alongside various genres using rhetorical analysis. Results: Looking at two significant documents-job descriptions and bylaws-I found that ambiguity was rarely benign at Owen's House. In the job descriptions, ambiguity rendered key positions dysfunctional and undermined the collective, resulting in a crisis. However, ambiguity in the bylaws allowed the collective to reinterpret organizational goals in support of necessary changes critical to achieving solvency. Conclusion: When building unified diversity, democratic organizations must consider the positive and negative consequences of textual ambiguity. This consideration should extend to regulatory documents where clarity is often an assumed objective.

Method: Rhetorical analysis of four select infographics created by the New York Times to communicate Ebola risk during the outbreak that began in West Africa in 2014 using the following facets associated with design in global contexts: use of warm and cool colors, high versus low-context, and collectivism versus individualism. Results: Data visualizations dramatically shape how risks are perceived. Language-based content may communicate one message about risk, while the visual strategies used in data visualizations may communicate a very different message. Rather than emphasizing control over the outbreak, I argue that the visual message in the infographics in this analysis communicates the opposite. Maps show Ebola breaching national (Figures 1 and 4) and international borders (Figure 2), and line graphs (Figure 3) show sharp increases in cases and deaths in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Conclusion: Warm colors increase risk perception. Further, data visualizations are high-context, collectivistic forms of visual communication, which lessen risk perception among experts but intensify risk perception among nonexperts. Technical communicators can draw from the following guidelines when constructing data visualizations that communicate risk for intercultural audiences: show quantitative information using a variety of visualization strategies, include explanatory text and/or visuals to more fully contextualize data visualizations, and add comparative data visualizations.",,,,,,,,,,,32,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2015,62,4,,,,,244,257,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: This is a mixed-methods study that includes a) narrative inquiry and b) social network analysis. The study is based on two different disasters: the April 2015 Nepal Earthquake and Hurricane Maria of 2017. I used narrative inquiry with 28 participants who represented government, non-governmental agencies, community organizers, activists, and students for the qualitative study portion of my research. For the social network analysis portion, I analyzed approximately 50 million tweets that were posted during the first week after both disasters. In this article, I showcased a word frequency display that focuses on the words uttered and written in response to the calamities. Results: Based on this method, I found that there were two different types of communication that happened during these two disasters: organizational communication and crisis publics communication, which was mediated by people from all walks of life. Conclusion: Technical communicators and publics (local or non-experts) who take up the role of technical communicators during a disaster can play an important role in providing accurate information and dispelling misinformation by working closely with the experts, scientists, journalists, and other officials.",,,,,,,,,,,43,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2022,69,2,,,,,58,74,,10.55177/tc658475,http://dx.doi.org/10.55177/tc658475,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The goal of this article is to provide a tutorial covering the writing genres used to develop well-planned informative, instructional, or persuasive videos. Method: The process and genres in this article are developed from a comprehensive literature review as well as eight years of course development teaching advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on technical video. Results: In this article, four genres for technical video planning and production are characterized, with examples, for industry practitioners, students, and instructors: video project proposal, storyboard, script, and shot list. Conclusion: The four-genres used to develop technical videos in industry begins with video project proposal specifying the content, video style, delivery mode of the video, budget, and project timeline. The second step is to create a storyboard, a scene-by-scene sequence of drawings detailing the story or information planned for the video. Next, the process of writing the script develops from the storyboard outline to a more detailed visual and narrated script that emphasizes both the content and style. As covered in the article, video scriptwriting differs from other forms of technical writing-somewhat more similar to an oral presentation rather than print documentation. Furthermore, the narration of technical videos is more complex and often subordinate to the dynamic visual communication (which is, optimally, the primary mode of communicating information to the audience). Finally, the fourth genre to consider is the shot list, which takes the content directly from the script and reorganizes scenes and shots by location for the production staff in order to streamline the filming stage.",,,,,,,,,,,59,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2021,68,3,,,,,56,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the first, we focused only on chatbot usability, information delivery, and design. In the second, we compared chatbot responses to those provided by search engines to identify areas of similarities and differences in terms of accuracy, functionality, and usability. Method: Test Case 1 uses an exploratory method to analyze chatbot functionality. Test Case 2 uses content analysis of search responses and corresponding chatbot responses. Data from two major telecommunication companies' websites-Sprint and Verizon-was used for both. Results: In Test Case 1, we found that chatbots are generally more flexible and helpful when they provide information directly in the chat pane and allow free-form text entry, in addition to several other related characteristics. This was critical to receiving the information we needed efficiently and accurately. Results of Test Case 2 show that chatbots provide less information than search results, have longer wait times, and rely less on algorithms to get responses and more on constant updating. Conclusion: Based on Test Case 1, we developed a heuristic that addresses usability, information design, and accessibility. In Test Case 2, we determined that search functionality is better than that of chatbots in terms of 1) speed of response, 2) accuracy of responses, 3) multiple formats for content delivery, and 4) ease of use and accessibility.",,,,,,,,,,,31,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021,68,2,,,,,22,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the publication needs and motivations of academics and practitioners have resulted in content alignment issues so divergent that it oftentimes appears that both parties are from different planets. Method: We empirically analyzed the content within 1,048 published articles over a 20-year period within core professional and academic forums. We coded the articles for variables related to topic and audience. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and correspondence analysis. Results: Our field's core content forums have evolved little over the last 27 years. Results also indicated distinct differences in article topics and audience that reflect the varying interests of academics and practitioners. Intercom and Technical Communication Quarterly emerged as the most defined forums. Conclusion: The incongruity within professional and academic articles further suggests that we are a fragmented discipline.

It explains how technical communicators might consider using a technique offered by a mobile application called App Abroad to document commonplace cultural interactions to support reflection from users from different cultures. Methods: The article draws from technical communication theory and practice to explain a bottom-up method of designing effective materials for international audiences. Results: By creating opportunities to document cultural encounters through media that can convey the complexity of face-to-face communication, readers learn to seek a more bottom-up approach to understanding culture. Conclusion: Because culture is not static but constantly transforming, technical communicators must challenge traditional models that seek to address culture from the perspective of a single, national cultural identity. Rather, a more bottom-up (that is, not predetermined) understanding of cultural communication practices is needed to help technical communicators create more effective materials for international users. A bottom-up understanding of culture can support improved intercultural technical communication outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,34,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2015,62,4,,,,,258,270,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Students had the options of working with engineering-related software or choosing a theoretical topic for an undergraduate English language project. Method: This practitioner case-study research is based on a mixed-methods approach. Students were asked to complete a quantitative evaluation survey, which was complemented by an analysis of students' project reports, presentations and the teacher's supervision log. The final reports functioned as both an assignment for marking and an evaluation of the project results. Results: In total, 14 out of 20 students returned an evaluation survey sheet. Based on the mean group rankings of statements on a five-point Likert scale (0 to 4 points), the results showed that students perceived several objectives as greatly achieved: expanding subject-specific vocabulary (3.35), working with scientific literature (3.21), following a given template for writing scientific texts (3.21), and practicing techniques of literature search (3.07). Furthermore, students found it very important that they could exercise autonomy during the project phase (3.78) and had been allowed free choice of the project topic (3.64). The five project groups submitted reports of generally good linguistic quality on different aeronautical subject areas. Conclusion: As it may be concluded from the questionnaire responses, students favored language learning through collaborative constructionist project activity and learner autonomy. A didactic framework that promotes these elements seems to be well suited for similar technical learning environments, although no direct generalizations can be made from this small-scale case study.",,,,,,,,,,,58,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2015,62,1,,,,,29,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

S. and provides information about the current number of degree programs, locations of degrees programs, and curricula, both required and elective. Method: We used course catalogs to analyze the curricula of 65 programs that offer majors in TPC. We employed qualitative inquiry methods based primarily on textual analysis and the deployment of codes to assign a summative attribute for course types. Results: We located 185 undergraduate programs in TPC in the U.

Degree programs no longer are predominately housed in English departments. The most significant gain is to the number of programs housed in Technical Communication Programs. The majority of programs require 30-36 hours of credit. A set of core courses are emerging in the field-wide curricula. There is a significant increase in the number of programs requiring document/information design, Web, internship, and capstone courses. In contrast, few require literature courses.

There is far less knowledge about Web design for children. For the first time, an overview is presented of the current design conventions for children's informational Web sites. Method: In this study a large corpus of 100 children's international, informational Web sites from four different domains (science, pets, arts, and health) is analyzed. The instrument for analyzing the Web sites included categories on visual design, navigation and information architecture. Results: The design conventions identified in this study show that designers of children's informational Web sites often follow general Web design guidelines. This study also shows that there is still much confusion about how to design Web sites for children. A closer look at the data revealed three categories of informational Web sites especially designed for children, diverging from a classical to a playful design approach. Conclusion: An overview is presented of the current design conventions for children's informational Web sites. The identified design conventions should be further tested and validated as design standards for children's informational Web design. Further, the design of children's informational Web sites is determined by two dimensions of aesthetics; classical and expressive. In this study, expressive aesthetics results in playful visual design or in a total playful interaction design. The effects of playful design on children's affect and cognition will be an important topic in future research on children's digital search behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,44,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2012,59,4,,,,,302,323,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: The study surveyed an international sample of 240 technical communicators who maintain Web sites to market their services, and then interviewed half of these survey respondents. Results: Aside from drawing in a moderate portion of clientele directly, these Web sites also helped recruit clientele who originated through such traditional marketing communication as referrals and networking. Yet such traditional communication tended not to be as useful in leading people to these sites as new-media communication, such as search engines and e-mail. Marketing communication's usefulness in leading people to a Web site is associated with that Web site's levels of success in recruiting clientele.

Method: The study adheres to the usability principle that successful design accommodates complex problem solving. Requirements specifications, the application, and the application's code are examined as part of the study. Results: The first determination is that composing detailed narratives within the requirements specifications can ensure flexible spaces for users, in this case doctors, to view, study, and manipulate data as they see fit. The article also acknowledges and accounts for the reality of low-level or code-level procedural programming required for creating such flexible spaces. The second determination is that employing narratological structures within requirements specifications also leads to technical inventions at the code level. Practitioners will have a better understanding of how their work facilitates the development of a software application's functionality, design, and even code.

Method: A comprehensive review of the literature with a case study as an extended example provides insights into the necessity of updating update how technical communicators create personas. Results: The literature review exposes major gaps in the research about persona development that, when compared to the case study, shows the need for technical communicators to update the dimensions of how personas are created and to reclaim the emphasis on goals and purposes of the user's practice. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to re-conceptualize the creation of personas by incorporating additional dimensions that create embodied personas for a mobile world and that reclaim and refocus the persona's emphasis on goals and purposes rather than simply a focus on audience.

This article explains how the content development community at IBM created meaningful standards, as well as the metrics to track their impact, as part of a closed-loop information quality process. Method: Instead of having one group dictate what the standards will be, the content developers at IBM worked together as a community to identify key requirements from internal and external sources, tested the standards with a set of key products, and then put the standards to use in increasingly larger numbers of products. Results: A community-driven approach to information quality standards allowed the IBM content developers to create standards that were meaningful to a variety of teams, ensuring that key aspects of information quality were addressed throughout the corporation. The use of metrics to track implementation and compliance allowed the IBM community to see when the standards were working, and when the standards needed to be updated to meet the changing needs of their clients.

Not only do children represent a growing segment of Internet users, much of what they do online has a specific purpose: education. To help technical communicators create educational Web sites for children, we offer a set of guidelines to direct the design process. Method: Nine children participated in a usability test of the CARES Playground, an educational Web site geared toward 7- to 9-year-olds. The site was designed by a group of graduate students in professional writing based on a review of the (admittedly limited) literature dealing with designing Web sites for children. This paper matches common themes from existing literature to the results of the usability tests. Results: Since all the information on designing Web sites for children emerged from the literature of designing Web sites for adults, the themes of navigation, appearance, and content are not unfamiliar. However, the interpretation of those common issues for children-as well as the children's reaction to them-may be surprising. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to be conscious and deliberate when designing Web sites for children. To ensure that educational Web sites are able to meet their learning goals, careful consideration of children's developmental abilities and Web preferences must be considered.

This step is focused on learning what the testimony in oversight hearings reveals about how the primary stakeholders of the February 2021 power loss event understood that event. Method: The researcher used NVivo, a content analysis application, to examine public comments, witness testimony, and a combination of legislators' press releases and the text of bills they drafted. All texts were generated in February and March 2021. The researcher ran both a word frequency analysis and a thematic analysis of each set of texts to identify topoi used by each stakeholder group and compared the results. Results: The analysis revealed that the three primary stakeholder groups perceived the February 2021 power loss event differently, though some of the most salient, significant, or urgent concerns of each group overlapped. The stakeholder groups shared some topoi, but the ways each group used those topoi suggested different ways of understanding and interpreting the event. Conclusions: Technical communicators who are tasked with reconciling technical and nontechnical audiences in situations like this can use the techniques discussed here to better identify specific places where the respective groups' use of topoi diverged from one another or aligned with one another.

However, deploying technologies (broadly defined) as a way of interfering with voter rights is not a new phenomenon. Methods: In this study, we identified and located historical literacy tests (along with other related texts) that were used to disenfranchise black voters in the U.S. from 1890-1965. We conducted a critical rhetorical analysis of the documents using McCornack's (1992) deceptive messaging criteria. Results: We found that even though the rhetorical and technical style and tone of the documents appeared to be objective and neutral, the literacy tests served as a technology of disenfranchisement, a way to oppress and marginalize, black voters. Conclusion: We argue that texts and technologies are not always designed with goodwill in mind and texts and technologies that are complicit in supporting and promoting oppressive practices have social, cultural, embodied, and material impacts on communities. We assert that technical communicators can look for possibilities and opportunities for resisting discrimination through texts.",,,,,,,,,,,38,29,29,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2018,65,4,,,,,371,386,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Schreiber, J","Schreiber, Joanna",,,Toward a Critical Alignment with Efficiency Philosophies,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Research has indicated technical and professional communicators (TPCs) continue to struggle with establishing value in the workplace. Studies advocate for more effective communication with management, but scholarship has yet to adequately address the relationship between establishing and explaining value and management philosophy. This article takes up the two issues of workplace value and speaking the language of business as they relate to management efficiency philosophy, specifically Lean and Six Sigma. I argue that management philosophy, particularly efficiency philosophies, is an integral, yet often overlooked, aspect of organizational context that affects both organizational structures and cultures. Method: I share the results of an ethnographic study of a series of trainings that were part of a Lean initiative. I buttress these observations with two documents, one internal and one customer-facing, from Lean Six Sigma initiatives. Results: The trainings illustrate the work of creating an organizational culture and the importance of communication in developing a sustainable Lean culture. The two documents are examples of how processes and workflow (e.g., organizational structures) are written in efficiency environments. Conclusion: Practitioners and researchers should see efficiency management philosophies as important components of organizational contexts not to be glossed over. Communication is acknowledged as important to maintaining culture, but TPC knowledge and expertise are not necessarily recognized. The two documents show opportunities in these kinds of cultures to make work visible and establish value.",,,,,,,,,,,19,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2017,64,1,,,,,27,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Self-Representation of Technical Communication Consultants, Independent Contractors, and Companies on the Web",TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: This article explores the purposes, character, and efficacy of about us information that technical communication contractors, consultants, and companies post on their business Web sites. Method: The study surveyed an international sample of 240 independent technical communicators who maintain Web sites to market their services, and interviewed a subset of survey respondents. Results: Overall, participants perceived their Web site's information about both their business and themselves to be somewhat useful in marketing their services, though they were also divided about which of these two types was the more useful. Regardless of whether their business comprised just themselves or a larger corporation with associates, some participants foregrounded their business's identity to build credibility whereas others foregrounded their own and their associates' personal identities to build rapport. Conclusion: About us information about a business and about its people can be usefully conceived as two distinct types of information, each deployed selectively to serve distinct purposes. Among the factors that may influence whether and how a technical communication business would foreground a corporate face or a personal face are not necessarily its corresponding corporate or personal status but instead the business's industry, its location internationally, its size, and the qualifications and gender of its people.",,,,,,,,,,,58,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2012,59,4,,,,,267,285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The article argues for the pedagogical value of standards through an examination of one particular standard: the Tag Data Standard, published by GS1. The analysis focuses on areas in which the document could be improved by technical communication practitioners and students. Method: The data for this article come from the 126-page Tag Data Standard. The standard was inductively analyzed using grounded theory and involved a second coder. The research question that guided this analysis was, How could this comprehensive standard be improved by trained technical communicators? The goal is to show how technical standards could be used to provide students with real-world texts to analyze and edit. Results: The data show the TDS could likely be improved if technical communication practitioners were more involved in the writing process to focus on issues of consistency, audience, and design. The article uses those results to show why standards could be valuable educational tools for teachers. Conclusion: Standards are a crucial form of technical communication. They are an example of how language shapes the material world. The analysis in this article shows that these crucial documents can be improved by skilled technical communicators and can serve multiple pedagogical goals, including showing students how documents shape materiality and providing students with comprehensive, real-world texts to work with and improve.",,,,,,,,,,,21,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2020,67,2,,,,,42,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: I asked twenty subjects to walk down a high school hallway decorated with flyers and posters. I interviewed them immediately afterward and one week later to determine which information stuck over time as well as the subjects' self-reported reasons for recalling information. I then analyzed the most-often remembered documents to correlate the subjects' responses to the documents' content, design, style, etc. Results: Contrast, color, and imagery are inherently attention-catching and memorable. However, engaging the audience's collective self-schema, or identity, impacts memory even more powerfully by prompting readers to ascribe relevance to information and thus strive to remember it. Accordingly, I propose the following heuristic for creating more effective, mnemonic documents: (a) convey practical value; (b) use contrast, color, and imagery; (c) tap the familiar; (d) introduce unexpected elements; (e) build social currency; and (f) arouse emotion. Conclusion: Technical communicators can enhance their documents' effectiveness by using the proposed heuristic to make information more memorable for their readers.",,,,,,,,,,,54,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2016,63,2,,,,,136,153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Does it give us an edge over our competitors in reaching out to people? Company executives ask these questions before allocating budgets and resources for the documentation team. A style guide is a rule-driven document that sets the parameters for consistency and acceptability of all written materials produced by an organization. But, is that the sole function of a style guide? This paper lays out key fundamentals of how to make an effective style guide and explores its benefits. The article also illustrates the process of developing a style guide in detail while satisfying the needs of the organization. Method: To understand the best practices in the industry, a comparative analysis of five style guides of global software companies was done. Further, an online survey was administered to the technical writing community to collect more information. To get first-hand feedback from professionals, seven technical writers were interviewed and discussions in online technical writing forums were facilitated. Result: In addition to generating document consistency, 82% of the survey participants concurred that an effective style guide helps in creating a distinct brand image. Word usage, new terminology, document formatting and meeting needs of global audience are important topics that need constant attention during designing a style guide. Conclusion: A style guide will have a successful impact when it is supported by management, incorporates broader inputs from all its beneficiaries, is integrated into the day-to-day operations, and is updated periodically.",,,,,,,,,,,14,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2015,62,3,,,,,183,192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, this study explores how Web design rules have evolved since the mid-1990s and the influencing factors, if Web design instruction has dictated rules or encouraged designers to think critically about the design decisions being made, and, finally, if Web design principles are based on cognitive learning or visual communication theories, situated in best practices, or simply replicated. Method: Content analysis of a sampling of 40 textbooks and general-interest publications on Web design from 1995 to 2014. Results: Overall, Web design texts encourage designers to think critically about audiences. Changing technology clearly played a key role in the evolution of instruction. Finally, Web design instruction included some level of reference to cognitive learning theory or visual communication theory. While the appearance of theory-based word units in Web design texts coupled with discussion about technological capabilities and audience suggests Web design instruction does a solid job of situating design practices in theory, technology, and the complex situations in which the Web user operates, the depth of discussion varies greatly from text to text. Conclusion: The various treatments of theory in texts calls for further study to better understand which approach is more effective in communicating the theories as a whole as well as their application in Web design.",,,,,,,,,,,67,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2014,61,4,,,,,245,256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

With video rapidly becoming a major instructional method, the question arises of their effectiveness for software training. This paper provides a set of eight guidelines for the construction of instructional videos for software training. Method: The guidelines present a concise view on how to design an instructional video for software training. They are based on a considerable body of research on how people process visual and verbal information and how to support these processes. Each guideline is described, illustrated, and supported with research findings from various disciplines. Results: The guidelines were tested in three consecutive empirical studies. In these studies a set of instructional videos for Word's formatting options were designed. The effects of the video instructions were compared with a paper tutorial (Van der Meij & Van der Meij, in preparation). We found that the video instructions yielded more favorable appraisals for motivation, higher skills proficiency immediately after training, and better skills retention after a one-week delay. Conclusions: The guidelines offer patterns that could further advance the theory and practice of the design of instructional videos for software training. A limitation of the study is that we concentrated on instructional video that serve a tutorial function. For video that function as a reference guide not all the guidelines are equally important, and also some new guidelines may be called for.",,,,,,,,,,,72,48,48,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2013,60,3,,,,,205,228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: Qualitative research was used in this study, specifically a case study based on ethnological methods including interviews, observations, and collection of relevant documents. Results: Localization of the social and physical spaces that surround organizational training spaces includes recognizing their potential function as an important site for professional communication, especially in relationship-oriented cultures such as Japan. Beyond the need for this conceptual understanding, localization of organizational training also requires the practical navigation of these spaces. Such facility depends on professional communicators' understanding of proxemics, or the human use of space in cultural contexts, as well as wise reliance on the guidance of cultural insiders. Conclusions: When professional communicators work to localize organizational training, they must include all relevant communication channels and work to actively manage the physical and social spaces through which relationships are built and information is passed.

Technical communicators need to understand cognitive biases , know how to tackle them accordingly. This article devises a framework of principles that provides technical communicators an operable affordance and a vocabulary to approach cognitive biases and to communicate empathetically. Method: I review a vast body of literature in technical communication with a focus on problems caused by cognitive biases. This work reveals significant problems in information visualization that can provide for a nuanced discussion on cognitive biases in technical communication. Using these problems as a guide, I draw upon cognitive theories in how people use information, the prospect theory about how people make decisions , the self-determination theory about how such decisions are influenced by the social context. I then assemble a framework of principles that illuminates the workings of cognitive biases. I extrapolate sample questions that technical communicators can use to examine cognitive biases in information visualization and technical communication.Results: The framework of principles explains how cognitive biases affect technical communication. These principles are useful for gaining a deeper understanding of users from a cognitive bias perspective and optimizing for empathetic communication.

Participants also completed a survey collecting their attitudes about the activity and alien drawings. Four coders then used a five-item rubric to evaluate the creativity of each drawing. Results: There were no differences in creativity scores for the alien drawings between the persona, self, and other author groups. However, people drawing for themselves and the persona author were more confident in their alien drawings and more willing to share them. Within the persona group, those participants who reported thinking about the persona while drawing had more positive feelings about the drawing and the author who would use it.

Results: Our analysis indicates that while flat design is the new trend, skeuomorphism has its place in UI design; each design has its advantages and shortcomings; and effective design may require the integration of both approaches. Our study also reveals that designs are culturally sensitive and that each particular design is contextualized and rhetorical. Flat design's popularity in the Chinese context has its unique rationale due to social, ideological, cultural, and linguistic reasons.

This study investigates whether popular YouTube instructional videos for declarative knowledge development differ in their physical characteristics from unpopular and average ones. Method: Sampling followed a three-step procedure. First, 250 YouTube videos aiming for declarative knowledge development were selected. Next, a formula for popularity rating was developed. After distinguishing three classes of popularity, the five most viewed videos for five types of declarative knowledge were selected. This resulted in a sample of 75 videos. After coding and scoring, statistical analyses were performed to discover differences between popularity classes in the physical characteristics of videos. Results: Popular videos differed significantly from unpopular and/or average videos in the following ways: (1) higher production quality (that is, resolution); (2) more frequent presence of static pictures (both iconic and analytic); (3) more frequent presence of a combination of static and dynamic pictures; (4) more often short on-screen texts; (5) more often subtitling with different languages; (6) more frequent inclusion of background music; (7) less background noise; (8) faster speaking rate (that is, words per minute).

J,"Aguilar, GL","Aguilar, Gabriel Lorenzo",,,World-Traveling to Redesign a Map for Migrant Women: Humanitarian Technical Communication in Praxis,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Humanitarian audiences are inaccessible to our traditional methods of research. Audiences like migrants often rely on technical communication to find humanitarian aid; however, there are few methodologies that can help us improve materials for them. This project explores world-traveling to demonstrate how the methods of other fields can help us take a proactive approach in critiquing and improving the technical communication from humanitarian operations.Methods: World-traveling is the practice of seeing through another's eyes to anticipate what they may need (Lugones, 2003). It calls us to travel from our privileged worlds, spaces we inhabit as scholars, into the worlds of vulnerable populations. The practice helps researchers understand the worlds of marginalized populations and help them. I world-travel to migrant women in an archive to improve a map that migrants use to find water in the Arizona desert.Results: World-traveling allowed me to anticipate problems. I found that migrant women are at a much higher risk of death by exposure than men and that the current maps of water hide this risk. I redesigned the map with the intent to lessen the risk of death by exposure for migrant women. The redesign made it clear that women are at risk of a certain harm while also taking steps to humanize the women displayed on the map.Conclusion: World-traveling allowed me to show migrant women the increased risk of death by exposure through a redesigned map. The result is more useful and humane technical communication.",,,,,,,,,,,23,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,69,3,,,,,56,72,,10.55177/tc485629,http://dx.doi.org/10.55177/tc485629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Mangum, RT","Mangum, Richard T.",,,Amplifying Indigenous Voices through a Community of Stories Approach,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Using the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) controversy as a case study, I argue that not only do counter narratives need to be told, but a reframing of storytelling toward what I call a community of stories approach is needed in order to amplify marginalized voices, particularly those of Indigenous people. Methods: Built on the foundational methodologies of case study and Indigenous methodologies, I investigate the documentation surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline case. In an effort to understand how to amplify Indigenous voices in counter narratives, I rely on antenarrative analysis, storytelling, and listening. Results: My findings suggest that conceptualizing stories as interrelated communities provides a strategy for amplifying Indigenous voices and revising Western approaches to environmental risk. I offer three different approaches to understanding the relationships among stories. The first is the dominant narrative versus counter narrative, the second is the layered narrative, and the third is a community of stories. Each of these three approaches offers an increasingly complex way of thinking about stories and storytelling, the relationships between power, and which stories are amplified and which ones are not. Conclusion: Decolonized storytelling methodologies and communities of stories can play important roles in helping technical communicators understand the diverse narratives of any case. Because there is not a case in the world that is not flanked by dominant and counter narratives-all cases have a dominant narrative and layers of counter narratives-technical communication and rhetoric (TCR) teachers and practitioners are presented with an important opportunity to do the critical work that communities of stories demand.",,,,,,,,,,,46,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,68,4,,,,,56,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Robisch, KA","Robisch, Katherine A.",,,Flexible Project Management Processes: A Case Study of a Distributed Trade Organization,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: This article examines project management and technical communicators at the distributed workplace of a trade association. Members work with association writers to actively influence the content and products, resulting in a unique rhetorical situation that drives iterative and flexible project management processes. Method: This case study draws from semi-structured retrospective interviews conducted as part of a larger ethnographic study of trade organization communicators, their educational products, and their interaction with association members. Results: The organizational structure of a trade organization results in a rhetorical situation in which technical communicators interact constantly with association members in both informal and formal settings, which leads to invention for informational products. The association restructured their communications team twice during this study in efforts to get more workers in contact with members and to create better content packages where editors, designers, and other specialists have input at multiple stages. Restructuring and the participation of members meant project management strategies must be flexible and arise from the rhetorical situation. Conclusion: Though not drawing on specific project management strategies like Six Sigma or Agile, this organization creates and adapts flexible processes so that technical communicators can best serve their organizational mission. In addition, processes respond to the rhetorical situation created between members and writers, as well as between managers and technical communicators. Managers work to empower these TCs who are taking on more project management roles.",,,,,,,,,,,34,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2018,65,2,,,SI,,136,152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Dragga, S","Dragga, Sam",,,Cooperation or Compliance: Building Dialogic Codes of Conduct,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Adapting the ethics of philosopher Henri Bergson, this article offers a theory to explain the volatile legal-ethical environment in which codes of conduct operate and proposes that technical communicators adopt this theory to build dialogic codes of conduct. Method: The article explicates and illustrates Bergson's theory of social and dynamic moralities (i.e., ethics as regulation of cooperative individuals and ethics as inspiration by heroic individuals) and offers a critical reading of three corporate codes of conduct from the perspective of this theory, emphasizing five factors: language emphasizing cooperation versus compliance, identification of authorship, clarity of ethical versus legal obligations, inclusion of humanizing pictorial images, and coverage of heroic individuals. Results: None of the corporate codes of conduct examined truly exploit the immense rhetorical power of narrative or illustrations. None exclusively emphasize cooperation or entirely specify authorship. None are altogether lucid or consistent in separating legal and ethical issues. Existing practices yield a missed opportunity to inspire as well as stipulate ethical behavior. Conclusion: Technical communicators are skilled in rhetoric, studied in ethics, and experienced in writing policies and instructions and in soliciting information from sources of knowledge and power. Technical communicators could thus be uniquely qualified to develop dialogic codes of conduct for corporations, industries, and professions.",,,,,,,,,,,68,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2011,58,1,,,,,4,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It enables professional writers to improve their writing. These techniques are also applicable to spoken discourse, including multimedia and interactive dialogues. Method: The investigation employs a linguistic framework derived from applied linguistics, psycholinguistics, and eye-movement research. The framework consists of (1) the triad of term, class, and characteristic, most familiar in the context of formal definition; (2) the location of the unfamiliar term in relation to the other parts of the explanation; (3) the distinctive marking of the term, usually with quotation marks or italics; and (4) the effect of explanatory context. Results: Certain syntactic constructions and distinctive marking assure readers that either the unfamiliar term will be explained or that an explanation of the term is not necessary for a productive reading of the text. Class-first constructions are especially versatile in introducing unfamiliar terms. Ongoing changes in reading and writing may lead to changes in the techniques used to introduce unfamiliar terms. Special cases are examined: parenthetical constructions, so-called as a means to introduce unfamiliar terms, the uses of extra-linear display (above-the-line and pop-up definitions), the problem of multiple instances of unfamiliar terms in lengthy documents, and the distinctive practices we find in online help systems. Conclusion: The linguistic framework developed here contributes to our understanding of how to introduce technical terminology and can improve the work of writers.",,,,,,,,,,,32,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2020,67,1,,,,,96,108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The lines between the real and virtual blur as gamers create documents across various modes and genres. This study looks not just at what gamers within these participatory cultures create but also how and why they create it. Method: I used a multi-dimensional case study approach to analyze content from 10 game-related websites. I then applied content analysis and rhetorical analysis to explore what types of technical communication artifacts are created on gaming websites, how such artifacts are created, and how gamers use technical communication to rhetorically represent themselves both socially and professionally within their gaming communities. Results: I present three major findings: (1) a list of genres of games-based technical communication; (2) an analysis of why gamers create such materials, including motivations linked to personal connections, professional connections, reputation, and rhetorical exigence; and (3) a discussion of how gamers write technical communication in the context of their affinity spaces and participatory cultures, as well as the modes and media they use. Conclusion: Players in participatory cultures consistently create game-based materials as part of their social identities, stretching across modes and media to suit their rhetorical goals.

T.; Karreman, Joyce",,,Cultural Differences and User Instructions: Effects of a Culturally Adapted Manual Structure on Western and Chinese Users,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Research shows that Western and Chinese technical communicators structure their documents in different ways. The research reported in this article is a first attempt to systematically explore the effects cultural adaptations of user instructions have on users. Specifically, we investigate whether Western (from Europe and North America) and Chinese (from the People's Republic of China) users would benefit from a document structure that is theoretically assumed to reflect their cultural preferences. Method: Using the SDL Trados Studio 2014 translation software package, a 2x2 experiment (N=80) was conducted with manual structure (Western versus Chinese) and cultural background (Western versus Chinese) as independent variables. The Chinese and Western manual structures were based on the literature on cultural differences between Western and Chinese technical communication. Dependent variables were task performance, knowledge, and appreciation of the software and the user instructions. Results: Contrary to our expectations, no significant differences were found between the conditions. Both Western and Chinese participants performed equally well and were equally appreciative when using the Western and Chinese manual structure. Conclusion: The results of our study raise questions about the validity and/or the relevance of the current insights regarding cultural differences in the structures of user instructions. Cultural differences found in content analytic research may reflect the habits of technical communicators rather than the preferences of users. However, caution is needed in interpreting our findings, as our research experiences also raised a number of methodological issues that must be addressed in future research.",,,,,,,,,,,59,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2015,62,3,,,,,163,182,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of the article is to explore the similarities between moderators of help forums and technical communicators. The article argues that technical communicators are uniquely suited to step in as community managers of companies' official online help forums. Method: This study reports on qualitative research done with 23 help forum moderators. The researcher used an iterative grounded theory approach to seek out research participants and code the interview data to examine emergent data categories. The research was also supplemented by six months of observation and an extensive memoing process. Results: The interviews with forum moderators show that help forum moderation requires many of the skills technical communicators already possess. Moderators play an important role in the health of online help forums, and they must be able to work with subject-matter experts, edit content, organize material, create content, and shape the overall tone of the forum. Conclusion: Many companies now sponsor official help forums, and these companies need community managers to run these sites. The data reported in this study show that technical communicators possess the skills to succeed in these positions and help develop professional online help forums. In conclusion, technical communicators have a strong case to make that they are well positioned to step in as community managers, especially of professionally sponsored online help forums.",,,,,,,,,,,32,18,18,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2014,61,3,,,,,173,184,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: As part of a larger project, the researchers observed and recorded (through video footage and field notes) translation activities taking place in a Language Services office during the course of two years. To visualize translation activities, the researchers used screencast recordings that captured how translators coordinated digital resources (e.g., digital translation tools, online dictionaries) to successfully translate information. Finally, the researchers conducted 12 artifact-based interviews with translators at the research site. Results: Results show that translation, technical communication, and design activities are enacted iteratively and recursively by participants at this research site. Translators at this site must work across diverse design processes (UX design, information design, visual and document design) that often get subsumed into the translation process. Although employees within this organization do not consider themselves designers or technical communicators, the work that takes place within this office requires expertise across these areas of study and practice. Conclusion: Designing and creating multilingual content often requires the intellectual contributions of individuals who can move across translation, technical communication, and design activities simultaneously. As the field of technical communication (particularly in the US) continues to acknowledge the value of global, multilingual content, it's important that we highlight the expertise and added value of the multilingual communicators who make this work possible and accessible to users across cultures and languages.",,,,,,,,,,,38,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2017,64,2,,,,,126,140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: Using leading design principles, I created postcards for the Office of the Washington Secretary of State that were mailed to unregistered residents. In addition to measuring the overall effectiveness of the postcards, the study evaluated the differences between two rhetorical messages. Both postcards described the same registration process, but one focused on the user-friendly aspects of the online application while the other emphasized that registering to vote is a social norm. Results: Residents in three counties with large Latino populations were mailed bilingual English-Spanish postcards. The total treatment effect was significantly higher among recipients in these counties than the rest of the state but with no noticeable difference between two rhetorical messages. Statewide, the overall results show that the postcard describing the voter registration experience as fast and easy was significantly more effective than persuading recipients to register using social pressure. Emphasizing convenience was especially effective among 18-year-olds. Conclusion: The study suggests that election administrators can create a more culturally inclusive voter registration process by designing bilingual outreach materials. This article offers several lessons learned for voter outreach design and discusses potential avenues for the continued study of culturally inclusive UX practices as applied to voter registration outreach.",,,,,,,,,,,38,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2017,64,2,,,,,154,165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this spirit, I examined the local ways in which community technology center (CTC) tutors helped teach inexperienced users how to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) during basic computer courses. Method: I collected data through ethnographic methods including participant-observation, qualitative interviews, and extant documents. Using grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Strauss & Corbin, 1990), I developed open codes and constantly compared codes to develop categories and properties. Results: Inexperienced ICT users are unable to utilize online and other resources because they often lack the necessary physical experience working with ICTs and the cultural knowledge to operate them. CTC tutors serve as local technical communication experts who construct effective methods for helping learners by: 1) utilizing visual representations, 2) utilizing audible representations, and 3) heightening learner awareness for visual cues. Conclusion: Inexperienced users struggle with using ICT hardware and software. An on-the-ground approach to studying usability in the field makes user experience research both more inclusive and comprehensive. Such insight from inexperienced users sheds light on how digital inequalities persist and how practitioners and scholars can work to ensure inexperienced users are not forgotten in UX research.",,,,,,,,,,,33,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2017,64,2,,,,,141,153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Swarts, J","Swarts, Jason",,,What User Forums Teach Us about Documentation and the Value Added by Technical Communicators,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: To describe the practice of technical documentation on software user forums and consider what value technical communicators add when they are no longer solely responsible for generating help content. Argue that documentation needs undergo a shift as users' tasks expand beyond what is directly accommodated in the software's design. Users no longer need stabilization knowledge (knowledge of what software is designed to do) but possibility knowledge (knowledge of what the software is capable of doing). Method: Interviews with moderators and frequent posters on four software user communities for Microsoft Excel, Adobe InDesign, Mozilla Thunderbird, and GIMP. Questions probe the participants' sense of what makes helpful contributions on software user forums. Answers are coded thematically. Results: Moderators and frequent posters stress the importance of maintaining high quality content and high quality social interactions. High quality content is that which is credible and situationally authentic, expansive, and targeted. High quality interactions are those that effectively involve multiple members of a community and distribute responsibility for addressing user problems to those community members with the most suitable experience/expertise. Conclusions: While community members may adequately generate the necessary help content, technical communicators are needed for abilities that are also strongly associated with the profession but that often seem of secondary importance. Technical communicators may be skilled moderators who can use their genre knowledge to correct, clarify, and contextualize software problems; use their interpersonal skills to help maintain ties among members of the community; and use their knowledge of text usability and organizational communication to create infrastructure for storing and retrieving help content that is performed in the user community.",,,,,,,,,,,22,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2015,62,1,,,,,19,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Rice-Bailey, T","Rice-Bailey, Tammy",,,Remote Technical Communicators: Accessing Audiences and Working on Project Teams,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: This pilot study investigates challenges experienced by technical communicators who work remotely from their audiences and project teams and identifies factors that contribute to success in these work arrangements. Method: I surveyed and interviewed seven technical communicators who worked remotely as consultants for large U.S. corporate organizations, including two Fortune 500 financial services companies, a professional services firm, and a safety certification organization. No participant performed more than 15% of her work on-site. Each participant had a minimum of three years' experience working remotely and had previous experience working as an on-site technical communicator for other organizations. The surveys and follow-up interviews provided qualitative data, which I then coded and analyzed. Results: Unlike local technical communicators, who may have limited contact with their end-user audience, these remote technical communicators had no direct contact with their end-user audience and instead relied on other in-house and remote team members (such as project managers) to provide audience information. The remote technical communicators reported facing challenges such as lack of social interaction; inability to stop working; and a lack of information and resources. They reported using various skills and strategies to cope with challenges, citing communication, self-discipline/motivation, and organization/structure the most frequently. Conclusion: Given the trend of organizations choosing to outsource writing and training jobs and hire consultants to take on these roles, technical communicators should acquaint themselves with the potential challenges of working on a remote team. Study participants reported such challenges as difficulty building trusting, new relationships; missing out on small talk and sometimes even critical conversations; and feeling isolated.",,,,,,,,,,,31,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2014,61,2,,,,,95,109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The goal of this method is to offer a time- and cost-effective instrument that enables organizations to easily classify an audience's interest in environmentalism, assess their willingness to listen to and accept environment-related messaging, and pinpoint the commonplace elements likely to be most useful in constructing environment-related communication. Method: I developed the interview, coding sheet, instructions for completing the process, and glossary that make up the Deep Audience Analysis instrument from existing data presented elsewhere (Ross 2013, 2012, 2008), and refined the instrument through both participatory design and usability testing. Results: The results of my testing suggest that the Deep Audience Analysis tool I propose is both valid and reliable, but training with the instrument would prove beneficial, and triangulation with multiple coders is optimal. Organizations adopting this method of audience analysis would do well to practice with the instrument and have norming sessions before putting the instrument to use in the field. Conclusion: The audience analysis instrument I propose here includes an interview script, code sheet, instructions for completing the process, and glossary.

At the same time, past research has indicated that non-profit professionals often lack the necessary training and expertise to leverage digital technologies for effective communication. This research study explores how technical communicators can assist non-profits by helping them develop effective content strategies. Method: This report of research findings is based on an ongoing Participatory Action Research (PAR) project, which included a series of focus groups with representatives of thirteen different organizations as well as interventions with several other organizations. The goal has been to learn about and help improve non-profit content strategy in the community of Greenville, North Carolina. Results: We found that while non-profits do rely on a variety of media to fulfill their goals, they prefer pre-digital media. Our participants also defined audiences in a very loose manner, used content in a non-targeted way, and favored existing organizational processes over content strategy best practices. Conclusions: Ultimately, we provide several ways technical communicators can assist non-profits through low-cost or free consulting and the development of educational materials.

J,"Mosco, M","Mosco, Michele",,,Plagiarism and Copyright: An Analysis of Technical Communication Textbooks,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Students enroll in college to gain expertise for the workplace. Students are trained in academia to avoid plagiarism by citing sources and refraining from copying others' written works. However, in workplace writing and technical communication, common workplace practices reuse, repurpose, and remix content of works authored by others. Unfortunately, this causes a significant disconnect between what students learn and how this learning applies in the workplace. The following questions guided the study: 1. How do the latest editions of widely used technical communication textbooks in the United States teach students about plagiarism, collaboration/authorship, copyright, and ethics? 2. How do the approaches used in textbooks align with workplace practices? Method: In the first phase of the analysis, each textbook was searched to locate any depictions of plagiarism, collaboration/authorship, copyright, and ethics as they relate to the workplace. Then a qualitative content analysis was conducted using a rating scale developed incorporating suggestions researchers made on how to best teach plagiarism and copyright infringement avoidance. Results: Each of the eight texts was rated on each criterion with a possible total of 30 points. Most texts scored 10 or less, one scored 12, and two of the texts scored 15 or above. The extent to which introductory textbooks address each of the criteria was generally abysmal. The texts largely did not address common types of workplace writing and how copyright and plagiarism apply in those situations. Conclusion: The majority of widely used introductory technical communication textbooks do not thoroughly and clearly explain plagiarism, collaboration/authorship, copyright, and ethics in workplace writing. Additionally, these textbooks do not present context-specific scenarios to which students can apply this information. However, several of the texts do provide examples of workplace activities that contradict academic views of authorship.",,,,,,,,,,,43,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021,68,2,,,,,87,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Agboka, GY","Agboka, Godvvin Y.",,,What is on the Traditional Herbal Medicine Label? Technical Communication and Patient Safety in Ghana,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: With a focus on patient safety in the marketing and use of non-prescription traditional herbal medicines (THMs), this article reports the findings of an analysis of documentation practices associated with 15 sampled THMs (nine labeled and six unlabeled) selected from stores, pharmaceutical shops, buses, traditional clinics, and streets of Ghana. The article is based on the fundamental assumption that THMs, much like conventional drugs, have side effects or toxic components, and therefore require effective documentation to alert users. Method: The article employs the purposive sampling strategy of critical case sampling to analyze the 15 THM samples. This approach allowed me to select information-rich cases. These cases shed light on the challenges of labeling THMs and how those challenges impact patient safety. Using these cases, I made logical generalizations based on the outcomes of the analysis of the data. Results: My observations revealed that some manufacturers made few attempts to provide information about the importance of pre-existing medical conditions, contraindications, period of use, who to contact or how to respond in case of overdose or adverse reactions, detailed dosage instructions, side effects, and potential drug interactions. Conclusion: Although medical and health communication is a growing area in the field of technical communication, the specific topic of patient safety as it relates to THM documentation remains underexplored. Moreover, the relationship between patient safety and THMs is an important aspect of the healthcare needs for many people, and therefore deserves more attention.",,,,,,,,,,,56,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,68,1,,,,,4,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: Using content analysis, I examined the following features on the homepages of the Chinese university websites three times in three consecutive months: 1. political/national agendas, 2. history and tradition, 3. important people, 4. groups of people; and 5. campus views. Results: My three examinations indicate that the Chinese university websites consistently show certain aspects of the above five features, which serve rhetorical and social purposes: political and national agenda claiming authorship of website content, history/tradition justifying current status, important people guiding university work, large groups of people showcasing the CPC ideologies, and campus buildings and structures symbolizing social elites. Conclusion: Confucianism helps us discern patterns in the design of Chinese university websites. Despite its limitations, this study serves as a small window into the many relationships between Confucianism and Chinese university websites.",,,,,,,,,,,98,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2020,67,2,,,,,8,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

I explore how Facebook's UX/interface design has contributed to user engagements that have implications for the current political context within which we live and work. Method: I engage in a critical user interface analysis focusing on four key microinteractions on the site: browsing, reacting, commenting, and posting. Results: My analysis shows that Facebook's user interface is structured around several design choices that create an ethic that prioritizes concision, speed, curation practices that limit divergent perspectives, and the flattening of complex identities and political commitments such that they are indexable, processable, and thus, monetizable. Conclusion: The analysis presented here considers the relationship between user experience design and political engagement. As such, this paper helps industry practitioners to see 1) how technology designs create new, mediated intimacies over time and 2) how those relationships have implications for user engagement with politicized content.",,,,,,,,,,,138,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2018,65,4,,,,,387,410,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: The article uses qualitative methods informed by theories of social network analysis to examine interview data collected from eight successful technical communication entrepreneurs. Results: Technical communication entrepreneurs actively publish and read publications to learn relevant information about the field, influence practice, and build professional conversations. Academic publications are often outside these entrepreneurs' scope of interest because of differing timescales, venues, and key terms; however, they often read publications of and publish toward the professional networks generated as they connect with others for business interests. Conclusion: The field must continue to find ways to bridge academic and practitioner divides by seeking common venues, shared timelines, and collaborating on emerging topics of interest. However, these divides are more complex than simply among academics and practitioners, as knowledge flows in the field have become multidirectional rather than two-sided.",,,,,,,,,,,36,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2016,63,4,,,,,299,313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

But academic researchers and journal editors know little beyond anecdotal stories about what industry readers actually think about the research articles they read in the journals. Method: To better understand practitioner experiences with and perspectives on academic research, we conducted a 25-question survey of 187 practicing technical communicators. Questions focused on experience with trade and academic publications; interest level in reading academic articles based on titles and abstracts; types of publications and content found most useful, valuable, and relevant; and suggested changes for how academic research is designed or reported. Results: The majority of respondents were either unfamiliar with or never or rarely read research published in the six main journals in the field. Common reasons given included difficulty finding and gaining access to journal articles, difficulty parsing practical applications, and difficulty making sense of dense and convoluted writing. But respondents also expressed strong interest in published research that has readily evident practical applications and relevance to current work practices. Conclusion: Academic research in the field has the potential to reach and impact much wider audiences. We offer specific suggestions for how journals, professional organizations, researchers, and practitioners can better promote and increase access to published research and increase its relevance, value, and accessibility for industry readers.",,,,,,,,,,,45,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2021,68,3,,,,,29,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We aim to enrich existing literature by sharing questionnaire results that begin to establish the state of the field in India. We discuss the way practitioners associated with the STC India chapter professionalize through education and training and innovate by experimenting with new genres and technologies. Method: We administered an online questionnaire with 32 questions among participants at the STC India conference in Bangalore; 76 people responded. The questionnaire asked about participants' professional backgrounds, vision for the future of TPC, and educational experiences. Data from the questionnaire, both qualitative and quantitative, was anonymized, coded, and evaluated. Results: The data suggest that practitioners in this study view their most significant role as writing and have high levels of content knowledge and experience with cross-cultural collaboration. They are educated in the technical and scientific fields but see themselves as lacking opportunities for university degrees in technical communication. Participants were aware of the constantly changing nature of the economy and workplaces and articulated how technical communication in India may be affected. The data illuminated the potential for improved cross-cultural partnerships in research and industry. Conclusion: Practitioners in this study possess high levels of education and understand the importance of change in technical communication. They are working to adapt and stay relevant in a rapidly changing field. The data suggest that these practitioners are seeking additional technical communication-specific training.

Method: The meetings from three sprints were audio-recorded and all spoken exchanges were transcribed. A codebook was developed to assess for meeting function PM language. A correspondence analysis assessed the association of Scrum meeting type and PM language. Results: The results of this exploratory study suggest that the Scrum team members use PM language in somewhat ritualized ways, particularly when some of the PM language is deployed. The correspondence analysis also suggests five associations between certain meeting types and certain PM language. Conclusion: This exploratory study provides a baseline of in situ Scrum-based project management upon which other studies may build, which may become useful as future studies may expand to include Kanban and Scrumban. It also suggests that while this Scrum-based group uses some PM language in expected ways (i.e., team maintenance is associated with kickoff meetings), other uses are unexpected (i.e., planning language is not associated with planning meetings).

J,"Thielsch, MT; Wirth, M","Thielsch, Meinald T.; Wirth, Manuel",,,Web-Based Annual Reports at First Contact: Corporate Image and Aesthetics,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Enterprises aim for a favorable corporate image and use their corporate annual reports to impart it. The annual report is a formal document that fulfills the mandatory disclosure requirements and serves as an organization's mass communication medium to inform shareholders, investors, employees, customers, suppliers, and the press, as well as the general public. In particular, large enterprises provide an additional online version of their report. We investigated user engagement at first contact with such Web-based annual reports and the influence of main report characteristics-content, usability, and aesthetics-on corporate image and overall impressions. Method: In a Web-based study, 155 participants read one of eight online corporate annual reports from German companies. Corporate image was assessed before and after browsing the report, overall impression afterwards. The report characteristics content, usability, and aesthetics were measured with established and validated questionnaires. Results: Findings were in line with our hypotheses: Corporate image significantly improved from before to after reading a Web-based annual report, even as reading time was short, demonstrating a mere exposure effect. The report characteristics content, usability, and aesthetics explained 20.5% of the variation in this increase and 66.0% of the overall impression of the reports; the best predictor was visual aesthetics. Conclusion: Content features of corporate reports are often limited by legal requirements, and usability of online reports is mainly driven by users' demands. However, organizations can positively influence their public perception by improving the visual design of their annual reports online.",,,,,,,,,,,76,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2017,64,4,,,,,282,296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Hirst, R","Hirst, Russel",,,Stories from the Secret City: Ray Smith's Art of Narrative as Rhetoric,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: To help readers better understand the craft and the rhetorical power of narrative as used in corporate and community settings-and to illustrate strategies that rhetorical storytellers may employ. Method: This article analyzes storytelling by means of a case study in the art of narrative as used in support of an organization, community, and industry. The organization is Y-12 National Security Complex, which makes parts for America's nuclear arsenal and does research and production in nuclear materials for medicine, biology, industry, and nuclear energy and propulsion. The community is Oak Ridge, Tennessee and environs. Industry references the nuclear industry in Oak Ridge and beyond, including its partnership with the U.S. military. The subject of the case study-the person whose narrative art is here analyzed-is Ray Smith, official historian of Y-12. The material analyzed comes from publications by Smith, notes from interviews with him on multiple occasions, and many sessions of listening to his stories both in person and via recordings (documentaries, presentations available on web sites, etc.). Results: This study finds that Smith's stories connected with the Manhattan Project, and the years preceding and succeeding it, constitute a model set of narratives displaying the rhetorical power of storytelling in an organizational setting. Conclusion: By studying the ways narrative is successfully used in professional settings, we deepen our understanding of rhetorical storytelling as well as our ability to use it. This skill has wide application to contexts of technical and professional communication. It can be used to elevate public opinion about a corporation, community, or industry; to breed confidence among consumers and investors; to construct leadership models for managers; to inspire and motivate employees-and in virtually any other sort of rhetorical enterprise.",,,,,,,,,,,21,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2017,64,1,,,,,6,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

As my organization discovered, few resources exist explaining the considerations involved in such an initiative, and there was a noted lack of information to help us plan for human-based factors affecting its success. This article attempts to fill that gap by relating our experiences. Method: We first monitored the CMS to understand its use by our organization's authors. Next, we conducted a survey to understand their perceptions of the system. We then made changes to the system based on the answers gathered in the survey. Finally, we monitored the system's use once more after the changes were made. Results: Our study suggested that authors did not want to use the new system because they were insecure in using it, perceived it as too difficult to use, and were unfamiliar with the system (among other issues). We then implemented a more familiar interface, created a version control system allowing them to revert to previous versions if they made mistakes, and created and deployed Web-based video tutorials. Finally, we tracked a noted increase in the use of the system by our authors. Conclusion: Based on our experience, for future technical communicators considering a CMS, I suggest involving those affected as soon as possible, implementing tools that are familiar, providing multiple methods of training, and creating mechanisms to ease anxiety about mistakes and errors.",,,,,,,,,,,18,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2012,59,2,,,,,99,111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

A grammar rule requires the use of the present subjunctive in such contexts. We tested a group of STEM majors at our university to see whether they were predisposed to use the present subjunctive in mandative that-clauses when they were composing new content or editing existing content. Methods: We administered two versions of a performance-based elicitation test in eight writing classes: (1) a complete-the-sentence version, in which the mandative that-clause lacked a complete predicate, and (2) a fill-in-the-blank version, in which the mandative that-clause lacked only a verb phrase (i.e., simple predicate). The former required composing new content, while the latter required editing existing content. Results: In the mandative that-clauses across both versions of the test, the present indicative was used in 51 percent of the responses, while the present subjunctive was used in 28 percent. The present subjunctive was used in 249 out of 720 responses (35 percent) on the complete-the-sentence version of the test, while it was used in 191 out of 828 responses (23 percent) on the fill-in-the-blank version. Conclusions: The students used the mandative subjunctive frequently, but they used the mandative indicative more frequently. They were more likely to use the mandative subjunctive when they were generating complete predicates (applying the grammar rule subconsciously in composing/drafting) than when they were supplying only simple predicates (applying the grammar rule consciously in editing/revising).",,,,,,,,,,,64,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021,68,2,,,,,61,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article illustrates such potential through the explication of a transmodal-translation process conducted on National Park Service brochures, including interpretation and transformation of their maps into acoustic forms. Method: Our mixed-methods approach included feedback from diverse blind, visually impaired, and sighted stakeholders, including administrators, media designers, and representative park-site users. These insights were then tested through field work and complemented by multiple interviews and focus groups. During this process, we developed digital tools-including open-source software and free mobile apps-for iterative testing and sharing of ideas. Results: Besides generating thematic and diverse insights about this topic, our study also established, developed, and refined a set of best-practices guidelines based on research in the field, informed by gathered empirical evidence. These guidelines are intended to support subject-matter experts at public attractions, regardless of discipline, in the creation of better, more accessible maps through Audio Description. Conclusion: How could a person possibly transform a complex, fully visual, and printed-on-paper map into useful acoustic media for blind and visually impaired visitors? After consulting the scattered, related literature, we oriented our efforts toward the multi-faceted technical communication practice of localization.

Method: An experiment is reported with four conditions: video-practice (VP), practice-video (PV), practice-video-practice (PVP), and video only (V). For motivation, the study assessed mood states and flow experience during training. In addition, task relevance and self-efficacy were measured before and after training. Learning was assessed with several performance tests for trained tasks. In addition, a transfer test was administered. Results: The findings for presence of practice were mixed. Practice increased training time and led to more negative mood states during training. A clear advantage of practice was found only on the transfer test. The findings for timing of practice favored a sequence in which instruction preceded practice. Perplexing results were found for the PVP condition. The highest learning gains were expected for this condition, but, instead, this condition had the lowest performance scores on a practice test and immediate post-test.

Scholars find a cross-disciplinary disparity on what interactivity embodies and accomplishes. This article traces the definitions of interactivity in existing research, devises seven dimensions of interactivity for wearables and IoT products, and identifies key roles for technical communicators in immersive media design. Method: A research review of key literature on interactivity in general and technical communication and mobile technologies in particular. Results: Current literature shows that concepts of interactivity in communication design and technology are multifaceted. Seven dimensions of interactivity can be derived for immersive media design: 1) reciprocity/ease of response, 2) synchronicity/context awareness, 3) connectedness/ubiquity/pervasiveness, 4) navigability/accessibility, 5) user control/personalization, 6) entertainment/sensibility, and 7) sensory stimulation/multimodality. These dimensions can be mapped onto the interactive design of wearables and IoT products. They also inform the roles of technical communicators in producing immersive technical communication. Conclusion: Further investigation of the constructs in interactivity can help uncover a more accurate relationship between interactivity and its dependent variables. The new dimensions of interactivity in immersive media environments suggest that technical communicators and designers must pay attention to 1) the seamless connection between the user and the systems, data, and actions; 2) user control and customization; 3) proactive contextual assistance from smart technologies; and 4) device sensibility and sensory stimulations.",,,,,,,,,,,87,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2018,65,1,,,,,46,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

To illustrate, we report a subset of findings regarding how technical and professional communication supports successful humanitarian work. Method: We conducted a three-phase longitudinal study of an international humanitarian organization. In Phases 1 and 2, we conducted phone/Skype interviews with 25 practitioners, a group including international, regional, national, and local levels of the organization. In Phase 3, we engaged in ethnographic observation of work practices in six countries and conducted a total of 95 additional interviews (in person) with humanitarian practitioners. Results: Communication plays an important role in the success of practitioners' day-to-day work when that communication pursues goals relevant to humanitarian culture, such as showing respect for local ways of operating. Specifically, our findings show that enacting humanitarian culture led practitioners to (a) localize how they speak, (b) collaboratively produce written documents, and (c) encourage bottom-up organizational communication. Conclusion: We found that while many of our field's skills and areas of expertise carried over to humanitarian environments, the values and motivations associated with humanitarian culture are what influenced the effective application of these skills and are, therefore, key to the effectiveness of communication. In particular, fine-grained localization and empowerment at the lowest level are central to professional communication that supports successful humanitarian work.",,,,,,,,,,,48,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2016,63,2,,,,,85,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

To support next-generation development efforts, a framework is proposed that will benefit the profession: integration with national efforts to develop knowledge taxonomies; conceptualization through metaphor; and application through imagined user groups (personas) and the communication tasks (genres) they commonly perform. Method: As an instrumental case study, the TCBOK can be understood and expanded through the complementary metaphors of relation and trading zones. Both metaphors are examined through a scenario of use for two personas. Results: While presently designed as taxonomy of knowledge, the TCBOK might be expanded through an ecological framework that embraces complexity of design and use. Conclusions: Three recommendations are provided that may help provide direction for TCBOK development: (1) Continue the use of persona as a key strategy for information development, but add high-quality genre models of best practice; (2) Expand attention from focus on cognitive competency domains to include intrapersonal and interpersonal domains; (3) Consider the knowledge portal as an opportunity to expand on other current efforts to articulate knowledge taxonomies.",,,,,,,,,,,43,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2013,60,4,,,,,267,278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study provides a view into how students make comments during a comprehensive edit of a technical document. Method: Undergraduate technical editing students performed a comprehensive edit of a report. Data were derived from the editorial comments students made during the edit. Comments were coded for level of the comment (global, paragraph, or sentence), phrasing of the comment, and quality of the comment. A total of 132 comments were coded. Results: Both effective and ineffective commenting habits were observed. Students were found to make a high percentage of paragraph-level comments and a low percentage of global and sentence-level comments. Most of the comments were rated as useful to an author. Looking at specific problem areas, most students missed commenting on four major problems within the text. The students seemed to be using a linear editing style of simply moving through the document from beginning to end, rather than using a top-down editing style or multiple passes. Conclusions: When given instructions to perform a comprehensive edit, most students made comments that addressed global and paragraph-level issues, rather than sentence-level or copyediting issues. However, the overall quality and usefulness of the comments varied widely. As part of improving both writing and editing skills, technical communication pedagogy needs to focus more on overall document structure and how to structure sections within a document.",,,,,,,,,,,27,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2011,58,1,,,,,52,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: This paper is grounded in the stories of 31 residents of rural West Virginia who share concerns about ongoing natural gas pipeline development. Through visual and place-based storytelling methods, walk-along interviews (Carpiano, 2009) and photovoice (Sullivan, 2017), a rich collection of stories and photographs that reveal the often-undocumented effects of pipeline development were gathered. Results: The stories of residents living in close proximity to natural gas pipelines reveal two main types of knowledge circulating in conversations about energy development: knowledge rooted in more traditional forms of epistemic authority, such as legal definitions and technical accounts of land; and situated knowledge derived from lived experiences of people directly impacted by technological and environmental changes. Conclusion: Ultimately, we argue that to embrace stories told by rural residents is to center the experiences of communities, which, in turn, legitimizes situated knowledge resulting from first-hand experience. This demonstrates that expertise can be located in spaces outside of corporate, technical, or academic knowledge, and encourages technical communicators to seek out that expertise in their own work.",,,,,,,,,,,56,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,68,4,,,,,40,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: We developed a theory-to-query method that uses a theoretical framework, computer logic, and collaborative research design to create a custom computer program to extract data from a large corpus of text. This research method uses an iterative approach involving both human and computer analysis to complete the necessary tasks. Results: Although we successfully created a custom computer program to parse citations, both human and computer analysis were needed to effectively extract data from the corpus. The allocation of labor (human vs. computer) was driven by the limitations of the data as well as by the limitations of human and computer abilities, rather than the type of task (e.g., repetitive, requiring pattern recognition). Conclusion: Interdisciplinary partners should use a framework to communicate effectively in their design process to better refine a project's scope, overcome unexpected limitations, and troubleshoot. Theory-to-query is a method that combines theoretical frameworks, computer logic, and collaborative research design to create custom programs that aid analysis, such as designing a program for extracting citations from a corpus of journal articles.

J,"Farkas, DK","Farkas, David K.",,,A Scheme for Understanding and Writing Summaries,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Writing a summary is not necessarily a straightforward task. Presented here is a scheme of twelve descriptors that reveals much of the complexity of summaries. The scheme can also serve as a design heuristic. Method: The scheme draws upon the psychology of text processing and applied linguistics, and derives theoretically from the intertextual relationship between the summary and the summarized text and the contrast between summary as microcosm (miniature of the summarized text) and the many ways in which summaries are not microcosmic. Results: The scheme consists of these twelve descriptors. The Purpose of the summary. The possibility of a Specification constraint that complicates the writing of the summary. Reduction, the length of a summary as a ratio of the summarized text. The Phrasing-informative or descriptive-of the summary. Proportion and Exclusion, how fully each part of the text is represented in the summary. Structure, how the ideas in the summary are arranged in relation to the text. Placement, where in relation to the text (before, after, within, alongside, or independent of) a summary (or multiple summaries) appears. Addition, the possibility of adding content not in the text to the summary. Authorship, whether the author of the text (or an associate) or someone not associated with the text wrote the summary. The Stance, Style, and Format of a summary. Conclusion: The scheme advances our understanding of summaries and, especially when used as a heuristic, can help technical communicators in their work.

Methods: Using an exploratory, mixed methods single-case study model, we analyzed discourse and technical communication practices in a community focused on designing and playing social deception games across a network of digital platforms, with an eye toward how administrators, designers, and players negotiated design challenges. Results: The amateur game design community observed here participates in professional design practices that can be mapped onto Eyman's (2008) framework for technical communication in games. Communities such as the subject-participants in this study produce unique documentation tracing design processes in ways some professional studios do not (Sansone, 2014) and foreground user experience considerations in observable, archived discussions. Conclusion: Amateur game design communities are as interested in maintaining strong user experiences and balanced gameplay as professional studios, as indicated by this study, and may use similar tactics to achieve results. The comparisons allowed construction of a framework for comparing amateur and professional designs in terms of tech comm practices. For technical communicators who must understand and account for world-making processes, demonstrating how amateur practice may compare to professional practice opens up new potential sites of study in the service of constructing game design ecologies.",,,,,,,,,,,32,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2019,66,3,,,,,257,271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: An instructional method was used in this study, specifically the introduction of minimalist documentation concepts and heuristics to instructional video production. This study compares assessment rubrics completed by students as pre- and post-test assessment data, though the success of the instructional method is not dependent upon these results. Results: After working with minimalism heuristics, student-produced videos showed greater attention to imperative mood language, task-orientation, and error representation than existing videos for Web applications. Though student-produced videos lacked production polish, they showed evidence of minimalist strategies.

Specific guidelines on how to create effective visual arguments that are useful as slides meant for presentations cannot be used as handouts. Method: The criteria were derived primarily from Doumont's (2002) three laws of professional communication that suggest how to combine rhetorical and visual elements to form coherent arguments. Results: The results show that Doumont's laws are helpful in judging the persuasiveness of the students' visual arguments. In addition, the weaknesses in the students' visual arguments applied to all three laws, which is in line with Doumont's view that the laws have an order of precedence.

Method: Cross-sectional sample survey of 1,000 STC members conducted in May 2008; multiple survey contacts by email with link to online survey instrument. Results: Of 276 respondents, half reported using SS/CM methods and tools. About 1 in 10 respondents reported experience with a failed implementation of SS/CM; half the SS/CM users reported significant downsides or tradeoffs. Perceived top drivers of SS/CM adoption were faster development, lower costs, regulatory and compliance pressures, and translation needs. About 1 in 9 respondents used Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). Large company size made use of SS/CM significantly more likely, and work groups using single sourcing with content management were significantly larger than work groups of other SS/CM subgroups and non-users of SS/CM. Single sourcing without content management seems destined to achieve a larger proportion of adopters than single sourcing with content management, barring a technology breakthrough. Among all respondents, Microsoft Word and FrameMaker were the most-used primary authoring tools. Conclusions: With regard to these methods and tools, STC members appear to be in the Early Majority phase of Everett M. Rogers's innovation adoption curve.

Method: We conducted a semantic analysis of 10 best-selling technical communication textbooks and present findings regarding the appearance of terms related to informative and persuasive concepts in three types of documents or genres: general discussions, reports, and presentations. To demonstrate the problematic findings in these books, we also examine and summarize recent literature in rhetoric and technical communication. Results: Overall, a delineation of some sort between informative and persuasive communication was typically present, which-as literature in rhetoric and technical communication shows-contradicts practitioners' roles as persuasive communicators. While some of the examined textbooks emphasized persuasion in their general discussions, this emphasis became inconsistent when they discussed oral presentations, and the genre of report-writing in particular lacked discussion about its persuasive elements.

Complicating the issue are emerging technologies that threaten to blackbox and obscure the function of voting systems. In addition to discussing the longstanding issue of trust in voting technology, this article provides a review of useful macro-scale concepts for practitioners to consider when working on projects related to electoral systems. Method: After providing a synthesis and overview of the broad principles of electoral integrity, I overview blockchain (the technology underlying Bitcoin), discuss its possible application to voting systems, and consider its implications for the broader goal of fostering voter trust and legitimacy. Results: Technologies such as blockchain have the potential to not only change the mechanics of voting but to change the very definitions of transparent and trustworthy as applied to election systems. Conclusion: Trust in elections systems is ultimately a rhetorical, rather than technical, effect. As technical communicators are increasingly called upon to unblackbox election technologies, they must remain attentive to the potentially shifting values that define trustworthiness for the electorate at certain historical moments.",,,,,,,,,,,41,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2018,65,4,,,,,411,421,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: We conducted an empirical analysis of 235 blog posts from June 2014 to March 2016. We analyzed and coded each post for 14 unique variables including article type, topic, and citation style. We then analyzed the data using both descriptive and inferential statistics in order to reveal patterns in the data. Results: An overwhelming majority of the blog posts were written by practitioners for practitioners. Of the 235 blog posts, the most common topics were technology, professionalization, and communication strategies. Of the technology posts written, DITA was by far the most common technology topic. The most common article types were argumentative, process, and how-to articles. While practitioners rarely blog about research, when they do, they spend most of their time writing about results and discussion as opposed to introductions or methodology. Finally, our analysis revealed that bloggers made intentional visual design choices when sharing knowledge via blogs. Conclusion: Practitioners use distinct knowledge dissemination patterns in blog conversations that shape how research is presented to the technical communication community. Understanding these patterns is an important first step toward developing a shared language that will help bridge the gap in understanding between the academic and practitioner communities. Ultimately, blogs are a useful forum for studying practitioner conversations and developing broader understanding about what they value in their work and research.",,,,,,,,,,,49,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2016,63,4,,,,,328,345,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of the study is to provide a better understanding of instructional video patterns and typologies and to find associations between video style usage and course attributes such as the MOOC platform and course subjects. Method: Five global, generalist MOOC platforms were selected for this study, which was conducted in two phases: First, a qualitative survey was made to identify frequently used video styles and build a classification scheme. Second, a sample of 115 courses in the selected MOOC platforms was used to account for video features and style frequencies. Various statistical tests were performed to discover associations between course characteristics and video style usage. Results: Seven video styles were identified as the most frequent in MOOC courses. They fully describe the video stock of 85% of the sampled courses. A typical course uses two different styles. The study reveals two broad competing approaches to display instructional contents in MOOC videos: speaker-centric (a visible person speaks the contents) and board-centric (a large rectangular surface displays the contents). The actual usage of each approach is significantly related to the course subject area: Arts and humanities courses exhibit a preference for speaker-centric styles, while engineering and hard science courses favor board-centric videos. Social sciences and health courses are more neutral. Conclusion: Current MOOCs are focused on few representational styles, with speakers and boards as the two main models.

Using Sun's (2012) distinction between user and practitioner localization, the researchers present a preliminary illustration of how translation is enacted by multilingual participants aiming to translate words from their heritage languages into English. Method: As part of this pilot study, ten, ten-minute interviews were conducted, video-recorded, and coded to better understand how multilingual users adapt information from their heritage languages into English. Results: Results suggest that users employ several strategies when translating in context: acting, comparing/contrasting, deconstructing, gesturing, intonation, negotiating, sketching, and storytelling. These strategies involve the use of both words and other semiotic resources (for example, gestures, intonation) to convey meaning across languages. Conclusion: Technical communication researchers and practitioners could develop more effective translation and localization frameworks by learning from the user-localized translation practices of multilinguals. Analyzing the translation practices of multilinguals who are not professional translators or interpreters could provide a framework for technical communicators to better recognize the complexities of writing in English for international audiences.",,,,,,,,,,,13,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2015,62,4,,,,,271,284,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, the focus in our explorative study is to understand these perspectives and attitudes to aid in the development of technology and technical communication curriculums for preservice teachers. Method: A phenomenological research approach was used to interview ten preservice teachers to explore the question, what is the nature of preservice teachers' experiences with technology and technical communication in the classroom? Results: Preservice teachers' educational experiences with technology and technical communication show a strong preference for using Microsoft PowerPoint to convey course content. However, a major theme from their perspectives and attitudes was negative toward formal PowerPoint communication training. Furthermore, participants stressed the over reliance on PowerPoint in the classroom; they desired more creativity and better ways of communicating course content.

These models not only affect revenue but, because generating revenue is central to the survival of an organization, affects all other operations. Method: Applies the theory of business models from the management literature to technical communication groups, using descriptions of technical communication groups from empirical studies to identify the most common business models for these groups and suggests how the source of revenue affects operations. Results: Technical communication groups typically fall into one of these models: (a) Venture Capital Model-groups that produce content published for sale; (b) Design Model-groups that design the architecture and oversee implementation of Web sites, large information campaigns, user interfaces, and designed-in information; (c) Agency Model-groups that produce marketing communication, employee communication, and other high profile content; (d) Development Shop Model-groups that support a strategic effort by developing help, user's guides, reference manuals, and similar product information; (e) Technical Support Model-groups that produce materials for internal users; and (f) Contractor Model-groups that update documentation for products and services have long life cycles (often lasting for decades). Although the literature on technical communication advocates for the Design model, most technical communication groups operate under the Development Shop, Technical Support, and Contracting Models, as well as mixed models.

This study analyzes characteristics of IT companies' technical communication tweets and relates them to users' online engagement (likes, retweets, replies). Three message characteristics were included: content, message elements, and communication strategies. Method: We collected technical communication tweets posted by four IT companies in two weeks (N = 1,604). We developed a content categorization and also coded the tweets for message elements, communication strategies, and online engagement. Message elements and communication strategies were compared with those used in the companies' corporate and marketing communication tweets. Negative binomial regression analyses were used to map relationships between message characteristics and online engagement. Results: Ten content types were distinguished, illustrating the versatile nature of technical communication on Twitter. Hyperlinks were the most prominent message element; two types of elements were less prevalent: elements enhancing attractiveness (photos, videos, emojis) and elements connecting to a broader Twitter discourse (hashtags, mentions). Communication strategies did not include community-building tweets; evoking action was most prominent. Several links were found between message characteristics and online engagement: Providing user instructions or updates and feedback opportunities, including photos or videos, and providing one-way information promoted online engagement. Conclusion: Although Twitter might work differently for technical communication than for other domains, it seems fruitful to add more attractive message elements and explore community-building strategies within technical communication. However, there is also reason to relativize the importance of online engagement indicators for technical communication.",,,,,,,,,,,56,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2022,69,2,,,,,18,35,,10.55177/tc657458,http://dx.doi.org/10.55177/tc657458,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Welhausen, CA; Bivens, KM","Welhausen, Candice A.; Bivens, Kristin Marie",,,mHealth Apps and Usability: Using User-Generated Content to Explore Users' Experiences with a Civilian First Responder App,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: This study uses a qualitative content analysis approach to analyze existing user-generated content (UGC) for a civilian first responder mobile health or mHealth app, PulsePoint Respond. We argue that online review comments for these apps, the type of UGC we analyzed, can provide a rich source of untapped data for practitioners working in UX. We offer a UGC commenting heuristic that can help practitioners more effectively identify users' functional and productive usability concerns. Method: We analyzed review comments (n=599) about PulsePoint Respond posted on the iOS platform between September 2016 and November 2019. Using open card sorting for data reduction, we eliminated 307 comments. We then created preliminary codes for the remaining 292 comments and used affinity diagramming to discuss, define, and finalize categories in order to analyze the final sample. Results: We created a total of 14 categories, including Unusable or not actionable comments (307) and comments that were classified as Multiple Categories (45). The remaining 12 categories included Accurate Notifications (28), Audio (49), Compatibility and Integrations (8), Currency (58), Improvements (49), Location (27), More Agencies (50), Naming and Descriptions (41), Operating System/Battery/Memory (6), Privacy (4), Updates (8), and Usability/Interface (23). Conclusion: We found that functional usability considerations remain important for users. However, many users also commented on the limitations of particular functionalities and/or described actions they sought to perform that were not supported by the app. Drawing from our analysis, we propose a UGC commenting heuristic that can help practitioners more effectively identify users' functional and productive usability concerns.",,,,,,,,,,,38,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2021,68,3,,,,,97,112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We posit that screen-capture video represents a distinct genre of technical communication, which leverages a specific set of formal features to communicate information to viewers. We propose and evaluate an initial catalog of formal features, grouping them in four categories: attention cues, segmentation cues, content features, and vocal performance. Method: To evaluate our catalog, we completed a systematic survey of the features of 200 screen-capture tutorial videos from YouTube. Results: We found that many of the features in our catalog are already being leveraged by screen-capture creators and, further, that use of these features is correlated with video viewership. Conclusion: We provide a practical catalog of formal features that screen-capture creators use to effectively convey information to viewers, and demonstrate that these features are predictive of video viewership. Further, our results suggest that certain features, like vocal performance and segmentation cues, are especially predictive of viewership.",,,,,,,,,,,50,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,68,1,,,,,56,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, successful projects are defined as projects that reached their funding goal; failed projects did not meet their funding goal. Method: Content analysis of 25 successful and 25 failed technology project videos. Cross-cultural analysis of successful U.S. videos and non-U.S. videos. Results: Successful project videos were more likely to include iconic and analytic still images and to demonstrate the final product; usually displayed a combination of static and dynamic pictures; and tended to use shorter on-screen texts. All videos comprised at least one of the kairos subtypes. Successful U.S. videos were more likely to present the creator onscreen, include static pictures and provide information on why the creator needed donations (logos). These also always referred to timeliness or a call to action (kairos). Successful non-U.S. videos were much more likely to refer to the exclusivity of the product (pathos) Conclusion: Kickstarter project videos are an important feature on the main project page and may influence potential supporters' decisions to fund projects. While other factors can also contribute to project success, an awareness of physical characteristics and rhetorical appeals of successful videos can help project campaigners, technical communication practitioners, and educators create more effective videos.",,,,,,,,,,,69,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019,66,4,,,,,319,346,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: The study design employed convergent parallel mixed methods to identify common themes. Qualitative data were collected through open-form survey questions, diary/activity logs with follow-up semi-structured interviews, and contextual inquiry methods. Quantitative data were collected through surveys with Likert-rating scales and choice questions. Data were collected using three sources (novice engineer, engineering manager, researcher) to triangulate methods and consisted of a macro-study, with 12 participant engineer/manager pairings, and a micro-study, with 4 pairings. Results: During data analysis, a major theme that emerged was project management communication activities, such as planning project activities, providing or soliciting updates on project activities, coordinating or facilitating a meeting or training session, and documenting and disseminating meeting discussions. Managers provide constructive criticism to novice engineers regarding their communication abilities. Specific themes were needing to (1) provide 'big picture' context prior to technical details; (2) develop clear, appropriate written and visual content; (3) provide confident, timely content to the audience; and (4) increase interactions with technicians and operators. Conclusions: Novice engineers fit into a technical and social context and communicate as project managers. These communications and activities are not reserved only for more experienced engineers. Additional research with novice engineers and project management communication activities would be helpful, including an analysis of the training and support needed to be effective communicators as project managers.",,,,,,,,,,,25,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2018,65,2,,,SI,,153,168,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: A rhetorical analysis was conducted of email messages written during the three crisis situations. The analysis was based on previous studies which indicate that writers of electronic messages provide insufficient information, compose writer-rather than reader-based texts, and use inappropriate formats for communicating complex or controversial issues. Results: A failure to include sufficient information characterized a number of the email messages sent prior to the BP/Horizon explosion. Writer-rather than reader-based messages were written prior to the BP/Horizon explosion as well as during the Columbia breakup. Some of these messages included personal and irrelevant information as well as social media conventions conflated with business formats. Various BP/Horizon oil rig messages were also often communicated in an inappropriate format for discussing complex and controversial information. On the other hand, email messages sent following the Skokie landslide appear to be reader-based, contain no personal or irrelevant information, are free of social media conventions, and provide responses in a timely manner. Conclusion: Had writers in the BP explosion and the Columbia breakup written reader-based texts as well as recognized the asynchronous nature of electronic communication, their messages may have been more effective.",,,,,,,,,,,33,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2017,64,3,,,,,194,209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Can Desnoyers' taxonomy facilitate better interdisciplinary communication in STEM ( Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields by helping practitioners choose more efficient data visuals? In addition, would adopting Desnoyers' taxonomy bypass the current discrepancies between academic and journal data visuals? Methods: To test Desnoyers' taxonomy's impact on efficient use of data visuals, I did an exploratory, pretest/posttest survey of 101 STEM students and their choices of data visuals before and after exposure to Desnoyers' taxonomy. Results: Students chose more complex and more efficient data visuals on the posttest, after exposure to Desnoyers' taxonomy. However, level in school did not change the effect of exposure. Conclusion: Students' reported use of data visuals supports prior research about discrepancies between academic and journal data visuals. Additionally, students might benefit from having more exposure and training in efficient data visuals. Further control group studies are needed to show if Desnoyers' taxonomy itself can increase students' comprehension and use of efficient data visuals as compared to pure explanation of data visuals. If the further studies demonstrate that, then researchers and creators in the field of data visualization could confidently adopt Desnoyers' taxonomy as a way to teach and reference data visuals consistently.",,,,,,,,,,,23,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2015,62,3,,,,,193,208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Batova, T","Batova, Tatiana",,,"Writing for the Participants of International Clinical Trials: Law, Ethics, and Culture",TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Regulatory authorities and health care practitioners participating in international clinical trials are often discussed in the technical writing literature. However, the most vulnerable audience-the participants-is left out of the conversation. The purpose of this article is to examine the influence of legal and cultural contexts on participant-directed informed consent documentation. Such examination will help technical communicators make informed consent documentation more user-centered. Method: Using excerpts from informed consents that I translated into Russian, examples from my six years as a localization specialist, and an overview of contradictory U.S., Russian, and international laws, I analyze the legal, ethical, and cultural considerations for informed consent documentation in international clinical trials. Results: The results of this analysis show that international regulations often differ from U.S. and Russian laws. In addition, the culture and way of life in the country where a clinical trial originates (e.g., the United States) might differ from those in the country where the trials are conducted (e.g., Russia). These differences influence the comprehension of information in informed consent documentation and a patient's decision to take part in a clinical trial. Technical communicators are often responsible for the difficult task of reconciling the contradictory issues raised in international clinical trial legislation, differences in legal systems of particular countries, and tensions between law and culture. Conclusion: I offer strategies that technical communicators can adapt to work in the best interests of their audience and to present user-centered information in informed consent documentation.",,,,,,,,,,,53,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2010,57,3,,,,,266,281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Meng, M","Meng, Michael",,,Effects of Visual Signaling in Screenshots: An Eye Tracking Study,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Screenshots are an important means of visualization in software documentation. One question technical communicators need to address when dealing with screenshots is whether visual signaling elements, such as arrows or frames, should be added in order to highlight relevant information. This article reports the results of an experimental study that examined whether signaling elements successfully guide visual attention of readers to relevant screenshot information as intended. A second goal was to find out whether visual signaling has a positive impact on how accurate and fast users execute the tasks which the screenshots support. Method: Two versions of a software tutorial were constructed that included screenshots with or without signaling elements. Participants' eye movements were recorded while they studied the tutorial and executed the tasks described therein. In addition to eye movement measures, accuracy of task execution and time to complete the tasks were determined as measures of overall success on the tasks. Results: Participants working with tutorials that used visual signaling executed more tasks correctly. No differences were found regarding the time needed to complete the tasks. Analysis of the eye tracking data showed that participants fixated relevant screenshot areas longer and more often if highlighted by signaling elements. Conclusions: The results provide evidence that adding signaling elements to screenshots is an effective means to guide the visual attention of users. As predicted by the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, visual signaling does not simply increase interest in pictures but helps users to select relevant information.",,,,,,,,,,,55,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019,66,4,,,,,396,411,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Towner, EB","Towner, Emil B.",,,Expository Warnings in Public Recreation and Tourism Spaces,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Every day, people are exposed to risks they either do not know exist or do not understand how to avoid. This is especially true in locations where the public may not expect or understand the danger around them-such as amusement parks, national parks, or unfamiliar vacation spots. Although a number of factors influence the effectiveness of a warning, this study focuses specifically on the use of expository versus abridged language in warning signs. Method: This research was conducted in two phases. First, I distributed an online survey that was completed by 303 participants who were randomly assigned to view one of two warning sign options and then were asked to describe the sign's meaning. Second, I conducted a content analysis of the survey responses using coding terms (related to Bloom's Taxonomy) to assess the levels of understanding that resulted from the two warning sign versions. Results: My findings indicate that people who viewed a longer, more detailed expository warning from a national park were more likely to understand the risks and consequences as well as how to apply the information to new situations or specific actions. In other words, they demonstrated a higher level of understanding risks and risk avoidance. Conclusions: In public recreation and tourism spaces, detailed expository warning signs may be more effective at helping the public understand unfamiliar risks and how to avoid them. However, reading times (max. 30 seconds) and contexts (near resting/standing areas) should be considered.",,,,,,,,,,,66,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019,66,4,,,,,347,362,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Sanchez, F","Sanchez, Fernando",,,Racial Gerrymandering and Geographic Information Systems: Subverting the 2011 Texas District Map with Election Technologies,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: This research contributes to the scholarship in technical communication on race by furthering work regarding latinidad and technical documentation. Method: This article looks specifically at the 2017 Texas court case involving the 2011 district map involving districts 23 and 35. The article also analyzes the methods with which legislative mapmakers operate and deploy GIS software. Results: As previous researchers have noted, latinidad is often constructed in political and governmental documents within the United States to position Latinos as a threat to White Americans. Frequently, this constructed threat is mitigated by inflating the contributions of White Americans over their Latino counterparts. Yet, this examination of the 2017 court case illustrates that mapmakers can also utilize Geographic Information Systems to gerrymander districts and thus suppress Latino's voting power to help White Americans maintain political power. Most worrisome is mapmakers' deference to and citation of the Voting Rights Act to justify the creation of districts that account for and control electoral agency. Conclusion: The article concludes by asserting that technical communicators move beyond compliance in order to account for multicultural publics and to avoid engaging in similar technological practices. It also encourages technical communicators to become more active in identifying practices that threaten democratic integrity and in using their skills to promote more socially equitable electoral practices across their teaching, research, and advocacy.",,,,,,,,,,,67,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2018,65,4,,,,,354,370,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: We analyzed 474 job postings in India and the United Kingdom/Ireland. We conducted a content analysis of the postings, coding for information products, technologies, professional competencies, and personal characteristics. We compared postings to postings for the US, utilizing ANOVA and CHI square measures to evaluate whether differences in the data were meaningful. Results: The study reveals substantial variation regarding employer expectations. US postings are characterized by higher experience levels and more qualifications than postings for the international markets, with greater focus on user documentation and reports, working with SMEs, usability/testing, technology, and personal characteristics. The Indian postings are the most distinct from the US positions, with differing experience levels and emphasis on what qualifications are important. Conclusion: The study emphasizes a need for greater understanding of international technical communication and the ways outsourcing may impact career choices. The variation across markets suggests that we cannot assume standard practices in the US transcend linguistic, geographical, and cultural boundaries. This is important both for meeting the challenges of outsourcing and for international collaborations more broadly. The study also highlights the need for curricula to address the complexities of a global workplace by providing students with both technical communication and intercultural competencies.",,,,,,,,,,,21,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2017,64,4,,,,,310,327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analysis seeks to answer three main questions: What genre/information product knowledge is important for success in the technical communication job market? What technology skills are essential for success in the technical communication job market? What professional competencies and personal characteristics are essential for success in the technical communication job market? Method: We analyzed almost 1,000 U.S. technical communication job postings from Monster. com. We mined the postings for position title, job type, education level, experience level, location, salary, and industry sector. We subsequently conducted a content analysis of the job descriptions, using open coding to identify information products, technologies, professional competencies, and personal characteristics. Results: The job postings exhibited enormous variety in position titles but fell into five main categories: Content Developer/Manager, Grant/Proposal Writer, Medical Writer, Social Media Writer, and Technical Writer/Editor. Information products and technology skills varied substantially with job type. The job postings showed some differentiation in professional competencies across job categories, but they also revealed competencies that were common to all categories.

We added verification steps and personal stories to user instructions for a cell phone, to find out how seniors (between 60 and 70 years) perceive these confidence-increasing motivational elements. Verification steps allow users to check if a procedure was carried out correctly. Personal stories describe how a fictitious user succeeded in completing a procedure. Method: The plus-minus method was used. Participants were asked to place pluses and minuses in cell phone user instructions to indicate their positive and negative reading experiences, and to explain their choices afterwards. Results: Verification steps are regarded as other, common parts of user instructions by seniors. Nineteen out of 20 participants appreciate verification steps, and they mainly encourage providing these because they are expected to decrease doubts, and increase user confidence and satisfaction. Personal stories tend to stand out compared to other, common parts of user instructions. Thirteen out of 20 participants appreciate personal stories, which use is mainly discouraged for redundancy reasons, and encouraged for their expected positive effects on user confidence and motivation.

J,"Everett, HL","Everett, Heidi L.",,,Amateur Hour: Credibility Testing for Small Business Web Sites,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Much has been written about the importance of Web site usability. However, a Web site that is usable in terms of navigation can still have credibility issues that reflect negatively on an organization. As a result, Website credibility assessments have gained popularity, but little research in that area has examined one of the most common forms of Web site communication-that is, small business Web sites that do not pose risk and do not offer e-commerce. This paper begins to address that gap by exploring the relationship between Web visitor expectations and their credibility judgments about a small business based on its Web site. Method: I conducted research based on principles of Prominence Interpretation Theory of Web credibility. This research included focus groups of likely consumers to explore the relationship between Web visitor expectations and judgments about the small business Web site and credibility judgments about the small business. Data from the focus groups was used to: (1) determine the factors that women use when setting expectations and making credibility judgments about a small business based on their Web experiences, and (2) identify if those factors vary generationally. Results: The results of the research revealed that likely consumers of the small business did not believe the Web experience projected a credible brand with which they would want to engage. In other words, a Web site that was intended to promote the products and the store was ironically hurting the business by turning away potential customers. Conclusion: I show how a six-step credibility test (based on Prominence-Interpretation Theory principles) can be used by communications consultants, Web site developers, and small-business owners. Such a test is an effective yet simple approach to gauging Web credibility judgments and making sustainable Web site changes in organizations with limited resources. The ease of this test combined with the time- and cost-effectiveness make it especially useful for small business Web sites, where expertise and resources may be limited.",,,,,,,,,,,20,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2013,60,2,,,,,118,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Additional benefits include more ready engagement by students in workplace-situated IR and the potential to address workplace communication problems. Challenges involved gaining permission for a study, communicating IR recommendations to industry stakeholders via the academic thesis genre, and implementing workplace change based on IR results. IR best practices included embedding IR throughout coursework, providing sufficient resources, establishing a schedule, working with an advisor, and cultivating peer support. Conclusion: IR's academic and professional value needs to be better communicated to prospective and current students, faculty, and industry stakeholders. Students need guided opportunities to reflect on IR's value to them as students and professionals, and they should have opportunities throughout coursework to identify an IR topic and build on it. More resources and opportunities for peer-to-peer IR support need to be developed as well as an alternate IR deliverable, more conducive to communicating research results to industry.",,,,,,,,,,,56,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2020,67,3,,,,,80,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Wright, D","Wright, David",,,Sounding Off: Toward a Rhetoric of Sound in Technical Communication,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: As digital media continue to proliferate into every aspect of our lives, sound is playing an ever-increasing role in the conveyance of information. Because digital messages via the Internet, cell phones, smart devices, and personal devices are typically shorter and more direct than traditional text-based communication, digital communication will necessarily improve via other, less textual cues. Visually, we already see this through the use of digital cues, such as emojis and graphical displays (e.g., GPS charts). But digital communication, in the future, will gain much from the expanded use of sound. As yet, no analytical framework for classifying sound in technical communication has been established. Method: The author revisits some historical uses of sound in technical communication before proposing a model for analyzing current and future sounds. Results: Tools that encompass signaling, linguistics, paralinguistics, extralinguistics, and rhetoric can be used to analyze complex sonic combinations and to generate new sounds for technical communication. Conclusions: A first model is proposed along with recommendations for the future.",,,,,,,,,,,35,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019,66,4,,,,,363,374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since project work is episodic, project professionals rarely have opportunity to reflect across projects to identify potential organizational, social, or tool-based contradictions affecting their work. Given these challenges, an opportunity exists for technical communicators to leverage skills in communication analysis and modeling to aid project professionals with reflective exercises. Method: We propose an Activity Theory framework to analyze and model email communications generated during a project lifecycle to help technical communicators identify emerging contradictions and provide reflective feedback loops for project workers. Using the Enron corpus, we offer a case study detailing the construction of a reflective activity-centric model for project workers. Results: Our case study provides empirical evidence that activity-centric models can be constructed using email and attachments when organized by the five process groups outlined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). Sample modeling and questions derived from the work offers examples for reflective engagement with project professionals. Conclusion: Activity-centric models derived from email records offer technical communicators an approach to identifying contradictions within and across projects. Resulting models and reflective exercises can support project professionals with feedback loops aimed at improving how they understand their work and the collective culture in which it is produced.",,,,,,,,,,,29,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2018,65,2,,,SI,,194,209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The goal of the article is to demonstrate how project management has been discussed and studied by the field. By analyzing the field's approach to project management, the article sets groundwork for research, pedagogies, and best practices that prepare technical and professional communicators to shape effective project management practices. Method: To achieve this goal, we assembled a sample of 326 sources across academic and practitioner publishing venues from the years 2005-2016. To comprise the sample, we used targeted keyword searches to identify published work that addressed project management in technical and professional communication. Results: Project management in technical and professional communication is often presented as an adjacent practice to other concepts or practices, such as leadership or documentation management. Additionally, project management is described or discussed primarily in terms of skills and relationships established through concepts such as teaming, collaboration, professional communication, communication theory, and education. Conclusion: The limited characterization of project management in the existing research creates the opportunity for technical and professional communicators (TPCs) to explicitly acknowledge the complexity of project management from a rhetorical perspective. The outcome of this rhetorical approach would position TPCs to develop and shape ethical and audience-focused PM practices through their communication expertise.",,,,,,,,,,,161,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2018,65,1,,,,,85,106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article presents a research approach technical communicators can use to better understand and design materials for the different contexts in which individual in other nations use a given technology or communication product. Method: I review how an understanding of the context in which individuals use an item (i.e., context of use) affects what constitutes usability in a setting. I then review how script theory (from cognitive psychology) and prototype theory (from linguistics) can be combined to create an effective method for identifying the variables affecting use in different cultural contexts. Results: A focused application of script theory can provide technical communicators with a framework for identifying the variables affecting usability in different cultural contexts. Such identification can be enhanced by a targeted application of prototype theory, and technical communicators can use a combination of script theory and prototype theory to develop communication products more attuned to different cultural contexts of use. Conclusion: When combined in a focused way, a script-prototype theory approach to researching the context of use in other cultures can help technical communicators better understand such contexts and design materials that better meet the expectations of users in other cultures.",,,,,,,,,,,45,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2017,64,2,,,,,113,125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study serves to bridge the gap between theoretical research of rhetoric and the needs of business communication practitioners by identifying the means of persuasion that can be used by online crowd funding entrepreneurs. Method: Qualitative analysis of thirteen crowd funding project descriptions posted on a major Web site-www.kickstarter.com-was performed to identify specific rhetorical techniques via text coding. The sample included the most-funded projects to date, one from each of the thirteen project categories on Kickstarter. Aristotle's concept of ethos, pathos, and logos served as a basic framework for developing a more detailed classification of rhetorical means of persuasion used in the projects. Results: The most-funded projects have been found to contain all three types of rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, and logos), subdivided into a total of twelve specific subtypes most commonly encountered in the descriptions from the sample. The subtype definitions have been developed and refined over the course of several reviews. Conclusion: The research data made it possible to create a rhetorical profile of a successful crowd funding project description representing a summary of the rhetorical techniques identified during the study. Although this summary reflects a hypothetical all-inclusive case, it can be used as a benchmark when drafting crowd funding project descriptions.

Although reflexive research is common in the sciences and social sciences, few studies have analyzed the body of research in technical communication. Clarity on content and authorship patterns can help position the field for future relevance and sustainability. Method: We conducted a quantitative content analysis on 672 articles published in five leading technical communication journals from 1996-2017. Articles were coded on nine content variables related to primary topic, primary audience, and authorship. We subsequently conducted a correspondence analysis on the variables to identify how specific content areas associated with the journals. Results: Content and authorship patterns were near identical to the patterns found in the field 30 years prior. The journals published content primarily focused on rhetoric, genre, pedagogy, and diversity. In contrast, field-defining topics-usability/UX, comprehension, design, and editing and style-appeared in the sample less than expected. A majority of research was single-authored and written by female first authors; further, a majority of the first authors had academic affiliations in the United States. Conclusion: Scholars must consider if these content and authorship patterns are the products of deliberate choices and, if so, if this is the field's inevitable trajectory for the next 30 years. We argue that certain topics are being overproduced while other topics that established the field are being underproduced and, in some cases, being assumed by other disciplines.",,,,,,,,,,,72,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2020,67,3,,,,,5,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: We examine Japanese military ideology at a particular stage in the war to contextualize a rhetorical analysis of the two translated texts. We explore rhetorical dynamics implicit within the text, the texts as part of the instructional genre, and ethical concerns particular to the context of the texts and desired actions they describe. Results: We explore different complementary and dynamic rhetorical aspects of the texts, such as their approach to their respective audiences, the recurring subjects of remorse and questioning orders, the normalization of the suicidal act, the need for mental toughness in the pilots, the recurring use of the imperative mood, and the dehumanizing role of images. We conclude that certain pilot mortality affects the instructional form, the language reinforces the inevitability of the suicidal act, the images included dehumanize the act further, and the manuals seem created to address potential disciplinary issues. Conclusion: Through the genre of procedure, the two manuals help legitimize and normalize an invariably suicidal act. The two manuals are gripping case studies for discussion of ethical technical communication across cultures, in situational context, and as instructional genre, illustrating the power of written procedure to facilitate extreme acts. We suggest further studies in military technical communication, emphasizing cultural differences between different militaries.",,,,,,,,,,,36,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2020,67,3,,,,,61,79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The concept of incorporating motivational theories for achieving health outcomes has been accepted as a valuable element across industries including public health, mental and physical healthcare, financial wellbeing, and education. The author will demonstrate how integrating principles from Self-Determination Theory-a leading theory of human motivation-with content strategy practices can successfully engage and motivate people across digital self-service platforms, focusing specifically on health care. Method: At Mad*Pow, the design team, content strategy team, and behavior change team have implemented content strategy practices in digital interventions via websites and applications. The creation of a content strategy guides the communication frequency, delivery style, information, and channels/touchpoints in order to best achieve the same goals that behavioral science does in face-to-face interventions. The intervention is then built, tested, and launched, after which the team tracks success metrics. Results: The Mad*Pow team has since measured results from clients and consumers, and can show how behavior change methodologies-as implemented using a strong content strategy-positively impact outcomes.

This manuscript provides readers with a survey of recent editing-related job requirements, gives a brief assessment of popular technical editing textbooks, and describes two iterations of an editing course redesign in which the authors gave students a broader exposure to editing than text and markup. Method: The authors examined the job postings in conjunction with course descriptions, popular technical editing textbooks, and other media to gauge how well undergraduate classes were helping students gain necessary competencies for entering the workforce. Following, the authors redeveloped the curriculum for a 4000-level technical editing class. The curriculum reduced the focus on text editing and markup; instead, it framed the diversity of the profession to students through working with editing manuals/standards, MS Word and Adobe Acrobat, and audio, video, and websites. At semester's end, students were asked to provide feedback on course and content. Results: The revisions to the course disrupted student notions of pencils, paper, and grammar as the backbone of editing. Students were surprised by the new media focus but found it to be very useful. Most had little idea about the breadth of technical editing and enjoyed the exposure to multimodal editing. Most students, however, wanted more work with language basics. Conclusion: Editing jobs are morphing and students need practice in new media environments. Students are able to consider editing competencies as extending beyond text and traditional markup. Yet, most still feel uncomfortable with their own expertise in those areas. Programs should develop more than one editing class: a basic class for language, tools, and technologies, and an advanced class focusing on specific editing topics, such as video, audio, images, and Web.",,,,,,,,,,,18,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2017,64,4,,,,,297,309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This model is based on a narrow yet comprehensive set of 15 distinct information quality dimensions (based on previous research by Wang and Strong, 1996) that cover all categories of information quality - Intrinsic, Contextual, Representational, and Accessibility (ICRA). Research was done to determine which information quality dimensions readers rated as most important per category (as they related to documentation), which were then used to create a clear, comprehensive, and empirically based definition of documentation quality from the readers' point of view. This definition of documentation quality is the heart of the model and provides a strong basis for measuring what readers want from the documentation we send them. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to readers, asking them to rate Wang & Strong's information quality dimensions in terms of importance as they applied to documentation. Dimensions were sorted by information quality category, and the most important dimension per category (as determined by weighted average) was calculated. Results: According to readers, the following four information quality dimensions are the most important per ICRA category for documentation: Accurate, Relevant, Easy to Understand, and Accessible (AREA).

This study explores different levels of motivation and ability, to identify which are most relevant for safety climate and safety performance. This study aims to pinpoint the areas information designers should focus on to most effectively contribute to healthy and safe work environments. Method: We designed a questionnaire for employees of a Dutch high-tech and high-risk warehouse, a workplace where safety regulations are important. The employees scored their attitudes regarding motivation, ability, safety climate, and safety performance. Results: The results confirmed the expected relationship between safety climate and safety performance. Of the explored sublevels of motivation and ability, personal motivation and external ability proved most relevant for creating a healthy safety climate and healthy safety performance. Conclusion: In the design of safety instructions, focusing on personal motivation and external ability seems a promising strategy for contributing to healthy and safe work environments, especially in high-risk environments.",,,,,,,,,,,61,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2014,61,4,,,,,232,244,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Beldad, A; Steehouder, M","Beldad, Ardion; Steehouder, Michael",,,Not That Button but the Other: Misunderstanding and Non-understanding in Helpdesk Encounters Involving Nonnative English Speakers,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: The internationalization of technical help over the phone is tied to the increasing usage of a lingua franca facilitating the interaction between a call center agent and a caller who are both linguistically different. Researchers have noted that interactions between two parties who are nonnative users of the language employed for the encounter are peppered with understanding problems. This study looks into the causes of understanding problems in helpdesk encounters between nonnative speakers of English and the techniques those interacting parties used to resolve or prevent flaws in the conversation. Method: Conversation analysis was used to analyze 25 recorded phone calls, amounting to 750 minutes of data, made in a commercial call center and in the helpdesk of an international academic institute in Enschede, the Netherlands. Results: Analysis of the phone calls reveals that causes of understanding problems between an agent and a caller who are nonnative users of English go beyond asymmetries in their proficiency with the language. Factors such as incomplete information or erroneous inference from the utterance of the partner in the interaction are important triggers for the occurrence of understanding problems. Consequently, call center agents and callers use varied repair and preventative techniques to ensure that understanding problems will not impede the attainment of the primary goal of the encounter-to resolve the product-related problem of the caller. Conclusion: While understanding problems are inevitable in helpdesk encounters, especially those that involved nonnative users of the language employed for the interaction, such problems are hardly attributable to the linguistic differences characterizing interacting parties. It is apparent that helpdesk agents and callers are equipped with varied techniques to resolve understanding problems or to prevent their inception.",,,,,,,,,,,49,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2012,59,3,,,,,179,194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

I call for centering the analysis of the power reticulations in context-specific technology localization.Method: I engaged in extensive review of existing research on the subject and conducted ethnographic and digital surveys with users and non-users of the technology I studied. This method provided nuanced perspectives on technology localization for a grounded user experience analysis.Results: Against current theoretical assumptions that support localization in user contexts as the solution to the chasm between developer culture and user culture, I argue that the reticular nature of power and developers' neglect of users' geo-epistemology also create a chasm within localization at users' sites.Conclusion: We need to examine the complex work of power in user contexts as part of a holistic theory on technology localization in user contexts. Thus, current assumptions must be revised. This revision must insist on the primary role of users' worldings in localization.

J,"Rantakokko, S","Rantakokko, Satu",,,Data Handling Process in Extended Reality (XR) When Delivering Technical Instructions,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Extended reality (XR) is a promising new medium that creates environments combining real and virtual elements or offers a completely virtual environment for people to experience. In the field of technical communication, XR offers a plethora of possibilities, such as augmenting critical instructions in a work environment.On the downside, XR brings about challenges. For example, issues of privacy and security require more attention due to the risks involved with XR devices continuously collecting data from the users and their surroundings. More knowledge concerning the use of XR as a medium to deliver technical instructions is required. In this article, I address this need by explaining how XR handles data.Methods: To find out how XR handles data, I used relevant previous research (33 papers and four books) as data for thematic analysis. I coded data systematically according to how XR has been used before and the phases that can be seen in the process of data handling in XR when it is used as a medium for technical instructions.Results: The data handled in XR can be divided into instructional data, such as assembly instructions, and collected data that XR equipment collects while someone is using it. Data handling in XR can be seen as a process. Based on the thematic analysis, I found six different phases of data handling: collection, processing, storage, transfer, combining, and presentation.Conclusion: The phases of data handling in XR illustrate in general what happens to the data in XR and what kind of data the equipment collects. My findings add to our understanding of XR as a medium to deliver technical instructions. They also offer a usable framework for mapping the differences between XR and other media as a way to deliver technical instructions.",,,,,,,,,,,28,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2022,69,2,,,,,75,96,,10.55177/tc734125,http://dx.doi.org/10.55177/tc734125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study experimentally investigates the effects Chinese and Western manual structures have on Chinese and Western users, in terms of task performance, user satisfaction, and information selection. Method: A 3x2 randomized experiment (N = 127) was conducted, with participants' cultural background (Chinese living in China, Chinese living in the Netherlands, and Westerners) and manual structure (Chinese versus Western) as independent variables and task performance, user satisfaction, and information selection as dependent variables. Supported by a manual, participants performed tasks with Excel and afterwards filled out a satisfaction questionnaire. To investigate information selection, eye-tracking data were collected. Results: Regarding task performance and user satisfaction, no significant main and interaction effects were found. Regarding information selection, our research confirmed some of the hypothesized differences between Chinese and Western users: Chinese users pay less attention to structuring elements (table of contents and headings) and more attention to visuals. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that cultural adaptations of the structure of manuals do not really matter: Chinese and Western users perform equally well and have similar satisfaction scores with Western and Chinese manual structures. Paradoxically, the differences found in users' information selection behaviors provided some support for the differences in document design practices. However, users of both cultures appear to be sufficiently flexible in using instructions that are not culturally adapted.",,,,,,,,,,,35,2,3,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,68,1,,,,,37,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Also, the study intended to help future researchers to better understand users' experience in seeking technical help. Method: To contribute to this research area, I examined 18 help desk visits between 11 users and 6 technical support providers in an in-person help desk at a four-year university in the Midwest United States. I analyzed the communication for stages of the conversation in which the component devoted to diagnosing technical problems existed, closely analyzed the dialogue of both speakers during this stage, and explored associations between the communication strategies they used and the user satisfaction based on a customer-support satisfaction survey. Results: The statistical tests suggested that more dialogue about the users' technical problem seems to associate with user satisfaction. The tests did not reveal a strong association between specific communication strategies and user satisfaction. The analysis of the visits showed how users shared their experiences through narratives and minimal responses, and how technical support providers used inquiries to understand user needs and experiences, providing a framework for understanding what the strategies look like. Conclusions: This research provides a reliable way of identifying and categorizing the ways two speakers communicate to diagnose a technical problem, which provides a framework for new technical support providers to communicate during this part of the discussion.",,,,,,,,,,,43,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019,66,4,,,,,375,395,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article discusses important characteristics of hypertext theory, developed over the last 70+ years, as a theoretical foundation that informs and defines the core competencies and practices of the field of technical communication. Method: This article initially reviews the significant literature on hypertext theory as well as recent selections, which help situate or define technical communication in the 21st century. From this literature, we developed a framework to examine correlations between characteristics of hypertext theory and compared those to skills, processes, and products in technical communication. Results: Hypertext is a foundational theory which informs the processes and practices of contemporary technical communication, and in particular, core competencies in developing content, design, structure, and in the processes of information development and user experience design. Given technological evolutions, technical communicators continue to work with content informed by hypertextual theories and practices, to create multi-pathed, user-driven, dynamic experiences. Conclusions: Characteristics of hypertext theory have become essential parts of the core competencies required in the daily work of technical communicators.

J,"Lancaster, A","Lancaster, Amber",,,"Identifying Risk Communication Deficiencies: Merging Distributed Usability, Integrated Scope, and Ethics of Care",TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Risk communication research examines how people communicate risk to prevent accidents and fatalities. Past studies have analyzed risk communication effectiveness from one of two frameworks: a textual approach (meaning is in the text) or a socio-cultural approach (meaning is external to the text). Some studies have merged textual and sociocultural approaches, yet none to date have merged both approaches with an analysis of usability and ethics, specifically. A more useful analysis would combine such approaches to examine the broader system that makes up risk communication, using distributed usability and what Spinuzzi (2003) called integrated scope with a lens on ethics. Method: I examine existing frameworks used to analyze risk communication and offer a merged framework emphasizing distributed usability, integrated scope, and an ethics of care philosophy for identifying communication deficiences. I use archival research to retrace a historical case of how artifacts were used in a communication system at an industrial setting when a fatal explosion occurred. Results: I use this historical case analysis to show that a merged framework with distributed usability, integrated scope, and an ethics of care philosophy provides a more comprehensive and concrete approach for identifying risk communication deficiencies and preventing injuries and fatalities. Conclusion: Examining complex work systems through this new merged framework expands our understanding of the interplay between textual-level components of our information (placement, accuracy, and details) and the social/cultural/political environments that define how workers act. Practitioners and researchers can apply this new merged framework to analyze past and current risk communication systems to identify usability deficiencies and prevent accidents.",,,,,,,,,,,42,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2018,65,3,,,,,247,264,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

One purpose is to convey a particular, non Western perspective which can be considered alongside existing literature to highlight similarities and differences in different contexts. Method: A qualitative field study investigating the question, What are some strategies and keys to communication that facilitate community engagement and stakeholder participation, especially related to issues of Agent Orange in Vietnamese contexts? We interviewed 38 participants across eleven provinces in north and central Vietnam. Results: The organization studied cultivates community engagement by: Conveying information through activities and experiences (experiencing information), powerful images (seeing information), and numbers (quantifying information) Using that information to promote community engagement by reducing stigma and drawing upon a sense of responsibility Conclusion: The organization's community engagement strategies are both similar to and different from those conveyed in existing research on community engagement practice. The purpose of community engagement prioritizes unity, not dissent-a major difference. But the organization is highly attuned to preserving human dignity a significant similarity.

We argue that localized community strategy is crucial not only to practice that aims for inclusivity and social justice but also to research and theory building that aims for inclusivity and social justice. Method: We model a dialogic, localized knowledge-making process that operates at the level of collaborative research between a theorist and a practitioner and at the level of international practice. The authors collaboratively analyzed the experiences of the practitioner, as well as our own collaboration process, and coded them for key dimensions, which can guide and be further developed both in practice and in research. Results: The authors identify and discuss four key dimensions of a community strategist's localization practices-localizing communities, localizing goals, localizing communication, and localizing inclusion-and illustrate them both in our own collaborative practice of analysis and in the practice of international community strategy.

Therefore, we focus in our explorative study on users' handling and evaluation of such software, including a comparison between educational and business users. Method: A total of 1014 participants (51% female, 49% male) took part in a web-based study. Among them were 444 students and 570 employees from different fields. The online questionnaire consisted of 67 questions in three parts and was based on the current literature and ratings of five experts. Results: Our results show a strong preference for using Microsoft PowerPoint, which led to rather satisfied users. Computer-based presentations are mainly used in educational settings, talks, and meetings. Differences between students and employees were identified, with the latter showing a broader use. Furthermore, independent of occupation, participants stressed the importance of usability aspects such as ease of use, compatibility, or loading speed; however, they equally desired more creativity in computer-based presentations and better speakers. Conclusions: The process of slide generation seems to be patchwork, and a large amount of time is spent on design and animation; thus we recommend measures to reduce the time spent on matters of visual style. In addition, current presentation software still suffers from several usability issues. Generally, the central function of the speaker and the supporting role of the presentation software are to be stressed.",,,,,,,,,,,41,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2012,59,2,,,,,112,123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

QuikScan employs within-document summaries formatted as numbered list items. These numbers correspond to numbers placed in the body of the document where the summarized ideas are discussed in full. QuikScan enables readers to (1) read summaries instead of the detailed content, (2) use the summaries as previews, (3) navigate quickly to the place where a summarized idea is fully discussed in the body of the document, and (4) direct other individuals to locations in the document. QuikScan is nonproprietary; anyone is free to use it and adapt it to their needs. Requirements: QuikScanning requires the skills of a talented editor and takes practice to master. QuikScanners must choose among four kinds of summaries and three numbering systems, depending on the document's heading structure and other factors. Document elements such as graphics require special techniques. The list items that make up QuikScan summaries must be skillfully written, and target numbers must be placed with care. Results: Empirical studies have demonstrated that QuikScan improves comprehension and the ability to navigate quickly through a document. In addition, QuikScan is regarded positively by readers. A pilot study suggests the value of QuikScan for blind readers. Drawbacks and limitations: QuikScan requires extra work, makes documents longer, and increases both visual complexity and the number of short pages.

Increasing diversity in the field starts with increasing diversity in academic programs and helping students from diverse backgrounds to graduate. Previous research has shown a lack of diversity in technical communication academic programs and a lack of inclusive practices in higher education in general. This study seeks to show how technical communication program administrators can increase support for students from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds through better inclusion.Method: I conducted qualitative interviews with undergraduate students, graduate students, and pre-tenured faculty members regarding their experiences in technical communication academic programs. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for emerging themes.Results: Interview participants identified several areas where TC academic programs can increase inclusion, including focusing on inclusion rather than simply increasing diversity, problems with microaggressions, lack of representation, and the complications brought about by intersectionality.Conclusion: TC academic programs, like higher education in general, are interested in increasing diversity. However, rather than focusing on simply increasing the number of students from diverse backgrounds, TC programs should focus on increasing program inclusiveness. This includes actively including diverse voices in program decision making and being willing to make changes based on the thoughts, ideas, and opinions of traditionally marginalized people.

J,"Rantakokko, S","Rantakokko, Satu",,,Creating a Model for Developing and Evaluating Technical Instructions that use Extended Reality,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Extended reality (XR) is an umbrella term for the many ways that we can now design 3D, interactive, and real-time environments as in combining virtual and real elements, and experience immersion in a completely virtual reality (VR). The use of XR is increasing in popularity across a range of industries. Although researchers are becoming increasingly interested in the benefits and challenges of using XR to convey technical instructions, more comprehensive research is required. I aim to address this need in the present article by introducing an affordance model of Technical Instructions in Extended Reality, the TIER model. Two earlier categorizations, the affordances of technical instructions, and the phases of data handling in XR, formed the point of departure for this article. The analysis utilized a four-category model of affordances by Rantakokko and Nuopponen (2019) that comprised: accessing, finding, understanding, and relying on. Data handling in XR drew on a phase-based model by Rantakokko (2022) featuring: collection, processing, storage, transfer, combining, and presentation. Methods: The two sets of categorizations were combined into a holistic model with an iterative process in order to offer a tool for analyzing and describing the possibilities and challenges that XR brings to designing technical instructions. The iterative process was conducted by adding examples from existing research into matrix tables to understand how the affordances of technical instructions and the phases of data handling in XR are connected. Results: The TIER model is introduced with examples to illustrate how it can be used to view every phase of XR data handling in terms of the affordances of technical instructions based on the laws, regulations, principles of good guidance, and the design process.

In 2013, van der Meij and van der Meij proposed eight guidelines for the design of instructional videos for software training. Since then, production techniques and video features evolved, and new insights about characteristics of effective video instructions emerged.Methods: Based on recent study outcomes and our reflections on instructional video designs, the original set of eight guidelines was restructured, updated, and extended.Results: A new framework with 11 guidelines was constructed. For these guidelines the article provides scientifically-based advice for the design of instructional videos for software training.Conclusion: The new framework and the illustrations of how the guidelines were applied in videos should provide useful insights for further practice and research on instructional video design.",,,,,,,,,,,108,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,69,3,,,,,5,23,,10.55177/tc786532,http://dx.doi.org/10.55177/tc786532,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Sentell, E","Sentell, Eric",,,Using Schema for Analyzing Audiences: Complexity and Simplicity Balance,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: This paper builds on a primary study (Sentell, 2016) that demonstrated how information can be presented more memorably through engaging an audience's collective (self)schema. It analyzes real-world examples of these strategies and theorizes implications for audience analysis. Method: An Uncle Sam poster promoting handwashing in a VA hospital and JFK's man on the moon speech are analyzed as notable examples of memorable communication. Each example illustrates (self)schema's influence on attention and recall as well as the strategies of engaging (self)schema: tapping the familiar, bridging to the unfamiliar, conveying practical value, and arousing emotions. I discuss how (self) schema can be used as a framework for analyzing audiences and developing personas. Results: Using (self)schema as a framework for audience analysis is an intuitive, holistic alternative to more time- and resource-intensive methods. It can balance the competing needs for complex, multidimensional representations of audience and limited, simple distillations of those representations that can be useful during composing. Analyzing an audience's (self)schema can clearly organize a variety of dimensions and generate insights into likely emotional predispositions. Understanding the audience's (self) schema facilitates using familiarity, unfamiliarity, practical value, and emotions to enhance information's memorableness. Conclusion: Technical communicators can use the concept of (self)schema to analyze audiences, craft personas, and engage the audience's (self)schema to make information more memorable, persuasive, and effective.",,,,,,,,,,,33,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,68,1,,,,,73,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Rosselot-Merritt, J","Rosselot-Merritt, Jeremy",,,Fertile Grounds: What Interviews of Working Professionals Can Tell Us about Perceptions of Technical Communication and the Viability of Technical Communication as a Field,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: In this paper, I discuss contemporary perspectives on the professionalization and legitimacy of technical and professional communication (TPC) as a field and describe results of an interview-based pilot study based in modified grounded theory. The purpose is to study perceptions of TPC and communication practice, particularly as those perceptions relate to professionalization and legitimacy of TPC as a field. Method: The method of data collection is the semi-structured interview. In the study, I interviewed 14 participants in diverse industries about formal communications produced by their organizations, their perceptions of technical communication practice, and the possibility that their organizations will hire a technical communicator in the future. I then used a modified grounded theory approach to data analysis: one cycle of structural coding, a second cycle of pattern coding. Results: Analysis of data suggests that, despite the importance of communication in organizations, perceptions of TPC as a field are variable and, though participants demonstrate a basic understanding of TPC practice, their perceptions are often incomplete, not reflecting the range of capabilities that TPC professionals often possess. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that challenges to the professionalization and legitimacy of TPC continue to exist. Addressing these challenges will require continuing alignment of academic and practical perspectives on the field, as well as continued work to promote TPC's value in a range of workplace settings.",,,,,,,,,,,65,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2020,67,1,,,,,38,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article suggests that articulating the value of TPC is an ongoing process, particularly for practitioners, who have found ways to combat stereotypes. Method: Findings are based on 39 qualitative, semistructured interviews with female practitioners of TPC. Participants were solicited across the United States and varied in age, class, industry, organization, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, and marital/family status. This article uses feminist research methodologies, with data from semistructured interviews analyzed through feminist content analysis. Results: The data suggests that TPC is still considered to be expendable in workplaces. Participants highlighted the misconceptions and mischaracterizations of their work, including the myths that TPC work is cosmetic, secretarial, unarticulated, unnecessary, invisible, and unquantifiable. However, practitioners are moving forward despite these misconceptions. They face a host of pressures, but these conflicts are opportunities to prove value and change misconceptions. Conclusion: Devaluation continues to permeate the profession, but practitioners have become skilled at combatting it. They know that educating others on the value of TPC is an ongoing project, highlighting the ability of practitioners to be an integral part of an expanding knowledge economy, all-edge adhocracies, and unique and networked organizations. Practitioners and scholars must continue to challenge and change stereotypes about TPC.",,,,,,,,,,,21,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2017,64,3,,,,,210,222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Kostelnick, C","Kostelnick, Charles",,,The Re-Emergence of Emotional Appeals in Interactive Data Visualization,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: I argue that emotional appeals, prevalent in charts and graphs during the later nineteenth century but largely dormant since then, have rapidly re-emerged in contemporary data visualization. Changing the relationship between designer and user, this new form of data design has intensified the affective impact of data displays by eliciting emotions ranging from excitement and empathy to anxiety and fear. Methods: This article draws on historical and contemporary sources to build its case. It gives an overview of emotional appeals in the rhetorical tradition, from Aristotle to modern theorists like George Campbell, who emphasized sensory responses through personalization and proximity. The article provides an historical overview of pathos appeals in data design during the later nineteenth century and the shift to modernist minimalism in the twentieth century. Contemporary examples from companies, nonprofits, government agencies, and individual designers illustrate how data visualization arouses emotion. Results: Emotional appeals during the nineteenth century focused primarily on color and design novelty, which, by appealing largely to the senses, fostered emotional responses such as excitement and curiosity. Contemporary data visualization makes similar emotional appeals through the use of color, novelty, and multimodal features; however, digital technology also allows designers to appeal to the emotions by personalizing displays through interactivity, spatial and temporal proximity, and aesthetic and expressive elements. Conclusion: Pathos (emotional) appeals have become an integral part of contemporary data visualization, largely because of the multimodal and interactive affordances of digital technology. Designers who understand this dimension of data design can deploy technology to make their displays more engaging, humane, and usable.",,,,,,,,,,,64,20,20,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2016,63,2,,,,,116,135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, I wanted to know if the designers of Souq.com relied solely on the universal principles of ICD to build a uniquely Arabized and successful site. Equally, I wanted to discover what other dimensions are in play when it comes to designing content for target users. Method: I reviewed the literature and developed a framework based on key indicators of ICD. I then analyzed the layout and Web content of Souq.com by examining interface and content, focusing on the homepage. Results: The principles of ICD, while foundational, require additional knowledge in order to meet the needs of local users and to build a sense of ownership of those principles. The process of designing for local users can benefit from insider knowledge and singular interpretation of a people's culture, language, and traditions. Conclusion: ICD is invaluable for the basic framework it offers.

A set of dedicated guidelines for the construction of such tutorials was recently advanced in Technical Communication (Van der Meij & Van der Meij, 2013). The present study set out to assess the cognitive and motivational effects of a video tutorial based on these guidelines. Method: Participants were 65 students (mean age 12.0 years) from elementary school. The procedure was as follows. First, students completed a pre-test. Next, they viewed videos and completed practice tasks. Finally, students completed a post-test and retention-test. Results: The pre-test revealed low scores on task relevance, and low initial task performance. During training, students reported positive mood states, high flow, and significantly higher task relevance than in pre-testing. Task performance rose significantly during training, and was also substantially higher on the post-test and retention-test than in pre-testing. Only cognitive factors significantly predicted task performance. Conclusion: The effectiveness of the video tutorial attests to the quality of the design guidelines on which it was based.

It proposes an alternative structure based on reader-oriented research. Method: Two card-sorting studies were used to identify reader expectations. In a closed card-sorting study, participants were provided with scenario questions on medication use and were asked under which of the template headings they expected to find information on each question. In an open sorting task, the schemata of patient information leaflet readers were explored. In this study, participants sorted a large set of sentences that can be found in actual patient information leaflets. Results: The closed card-sorting study reveals that users provided with the EU template structure do not always look at the correct section when searching information about patient situations. The results of the open card-sorting study indicate that readers prefer the following structure: goal of the medicine - directions for use - potential problems - packaging and storage. Conclusion: Card-sorting data help to evaluate and design text structures for genres such as patient information leaflets. The European template does not match users' expectations concerning the leaflet's structure. There is a mismatch between the wording of headings and reader interpretations. A second mismatch has to do with classifying and grouping information.

Method: We open by considering how technical communicators live, work, and do research in global contexts where distributed networks for the design, development, and distribution of documents, interfaces, and technologies span cultural and geographic borders. By drawing on published case work and interviews with technical communicators who work in global contexts, we examine the key legal and ethical issues technical communicators face when they are conducting Internet research. We propose heuristics for technical communicators to use when addressing these issues. Results: Key legal and regulatory issues that technical communicators face when conducting Internet research include the diversity of legal regimes, the variability of privacy laws and cultural differences, the impact of government surveillance on research risks, and the complexity of intellectual property in a global world. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to be aware of the potential legal and regulatory challenges they may encounter when conducting Internet research that spans cultural and geographic borders.

Method: Five open questions were asked of the university's five technical communication instructors in a 90-minute focus-group interview session to identify the important areas in pedagogy as conditioned by Chinese culture. The 300 students were surveyed to reveal their understanding of technical communication as it existed in China. Features as conditioned by Chinese culture and as manifested in the 300 students were also identified through my teaching and observing their performance in class. Results: The five instructors taught the same lessons and the same course content determined by the university. They focused on teaching professional terms and phrases. They administered examinations throughout a semester to help students memorize the terms. The 300 students generally thought that technical communication was about science and technology. The general audience of technical communication, for them, was basically their country, and the purpose was to serve their country and society. In class, these students often studied through collaboration in groups; they memorized almost everything from their professor; and they preferred a broad thinking style to tackling broad issues. Conclusions: Technical communication pedagogy is governed by Confucianism and the test-oriented Chinese society. In class, students were motivated by the collectivism Chinese culture stresses. Students' rote learning approach was influenced by their traditional way of learning, and the broad thinking style was a textual mechanism for students to complete assignments while upholding patriotism.",,,,,,,,,,,45,2,3,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2011,58,1,,,,,34,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: I use interface rhetoric to examine key considerations of audience agency for natural history apps, focusing on five bird identification guide apps, part of a technical genre associated with historically established-though evolving-use practices. I analyze and discuss how the rhetorical choices of developers may empower audiences to understand nature or frame their interactions with nature in certain ways. Results: I identify three overlapping ways these apps function as interfaces for users: 1) to frame their audience's experience of and relations to a body of natural history knowledge, 2) to model the conventions and practices of the birding community, and 3) to frame their audience's understanding of the natural world as a whole.

To investigate differences in user perceptions of commercial and official manuals, we conducted two studies: one focusing on user expectations and one on user experiences. Method: The first study was an online experiment, in which two groups of participants answered questions about their expectations of a (commercial or official) manual. The second study was a 2x2 experiment, with perceived source (commercial or official) and the actual content of the instructions (commercial or official) as independent variables, and task performance and users' judgments as dependent variables. Results: The first study showed that users have different expectations of commercial and official manuals, and overall think more positively about a commercial manual. The second study showed that perceived source had a significant effect on task performance: Participants worked better when they thought they used a commercial manual. No differences were found regarding participants' judgments of the manual. Conclusion: Our research indicates a potential image problem of official user manuals. Even though we found no evidence for a lower quality of the official manual's content, users' relatively negative expectations of an official manual may discourage them from using the official user instructions.

This study addresses the gap by asking managers about the extent to which they track two measures of value-productivity and effectiveness-as well as the expectations of sponsors for receiving reports on these issues. Method: A survey of corporate communication, training, and technical communication groups was conducted. Participants were recruited through local chapters of the STC and the American Medical Writers Association. Ninety technical communication managers responded. Results: The evidence suggests that activities for tracking productivity by technical communication managers are limited. Technical communication groups rarely solicit feedback and perceptions on individual communication products and employ usability testing on a limited basis. Technical communicators rarely track return on investment (ROI). Technical communication managers feel limited pressure to report productivity and effectiveness. The most significant criteria against which the productivity and effectiveness of technical communication groups is assessed is word of mouth. The evidence only partially supports this entering belief: Customer surveys play an important role in assessing general impressions of technical communication products. Conclusions: These results are consistent with earlier studies and suggest that despite a discussion about means of assessing the productivity and effectiveness of technical communicators that has spanned over a quarter of a century, none of the methods of assessment has reached wide use. The study also suggests that perceptions are the most significant factor in assessing the value of technical communication products and services, and should be given more focus in future research and writing on this topic.",,,,,,,,,,,47,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2014,61,3,,,,,147,172,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

From our interest in this trend as well as our aims to bridge workplace and classroom contexts, we conducted a case study of the networked interactions of key actors involved in iFixit's Technical Writing Project, as enacted in a technical writing classroom at a state university. Method: From Latour's definition of an actor as a component of a network capable of impacting other components, we conducted a qualitative case study examining the interactions of technical writers, technical writing students, technological devices, tools, and wiki technologies during students' completion of the Technical Writing Project. In particular, we examined how these actors exerted rhetorical impacts on one other during students' writing processes. Results: The results of our study were that the Technical Writing Project asked students to assemble a complex rhetorical situation that involved technical knowledge-making as well as assembling both human and nonhuman actors to create high-quality documentation. Further, this documentation was created in a situation strongly influenced by both workplace realities and the interactions enabled by an open source wiki that allows for contributions by interested Internet users.

J,"Rife, MC","Rife, Martine Courant",,,Copyright Law as Mediational Means: Report on a Mixed Methods Study of US Professional Writers,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: This article reports on 12 select findings from a sequential mixed-methods, empirical study of U. S. educational-context professional writers composing for the Web. The study explores the status of knowledge and understanding of U. S. copyright law, levels of chilled speech, and the use of rhetorical invention in such digital writing contexts. Method: Research methods include a digital survey receiving 334 responses from randomly selected students/teachers and discourse-based interviews with seven of these participants. Results: With respect to authorship, Web writers sometimes occupy conflicting positions. Empirical evidence challenges traditional ideas of authorship, i.e., a single author working alone in a garret, producing texts from his or her sole creative genius. The study finds digital writers' speech is not as chilled as one might expect, and while knowledge of copyright law is important to digital writers, they are fairly confident in the knowledge they have. Copyright law is not the primary concern of digital writers. As it turns out, ethics trumps the law in importance when considering digital composing choices. In the area of copyright knowledge, key misunderstandings appeared among writers. For example: confusion on (1) the difference between copyright and plagiarism, (2) unauthorized use and authorized use, (3) the government exception to copyright, and (4) the fact that U. S. copyright law protects creative work to a higher extent than it protects factual work. Conclusion: The study hopes to provide a methodology for further research, and a baseline in the area of knowledge and understanding of copyright law as it intersects with invention, among the professional writing population.",,,,,,,,,,,73,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2010,57,1,,,,,44,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This data provides insight into trends, tools, organizations, and events prevalent in the #TechComm community. Method: The study reports outcomes of four methods. First, statistical analyses were used to analyze 75,333 tweets from the most active 290 members of the #TechComm community. Second, profile data from community members' profiles were coded per mutually exclusive categories. Third, the TAGS Explorer, which uses Google's visualization API, was used to explore networks and sub-networks. Finally, a principal components analysis was conducted to examine topics and to identify significant themes in the tweets. Results: Members of the #TechComm community are diverse, with a majority being practitioners. Most members self-identify as technical communicators or writers, but other job titles include content specialist, software documentation specialist, and manager. Considering members' relationships and interactions, data visualization highlighted two major networks: academics and practitioners. Among academics, most of the conversation was facilitated by a few users. In contrast, practitioners participated in smaller sub-networks. In the conversations, eight major themes arose from the principal components analysis; themes include Adobe, DITA/XML, academic #TechComm, and STC. Conclusion: The study reveals potential areas where the divide between practitioners and academics could be bridged; these areas include curricular inclusion of DITA/XML and Twitter as a venue for research feedback from practitioners.",,,,,,,,,,,33,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021,68,2,,,,,5,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Renguette, C","Renguette, Corinne",,,"Technical Communication, Academic Research, and Patient Education: A Multidisciplinary Collaboration",TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: Recent changes in health care in the US have made it important for health information to become easier to access, understand, and use. Making medical decisions without adequate information can lead to poor health outcomes. Providers are being incentivized to improve the quality and value of patient-centered communication and care. Technical communication practitioners can collaborate with interdisciplinary professionals to help these initiatives succeed. Method: A patient education software application was developed with an interdisciplinary collaboration between a medical animation company, a surgery clinic, and an academic researcher who is also a technical communication practitioner. User-centered design principles were employed in the development of the application. Interviews were conducted to reveal insights about the application's influence on the language participants used to discuss the procedure. Results: Participants who used the software application to learn about the procedure were able to consistently recognize and recall more informational and procedural knowledge than participants who did not use the application. Conclusion: Collaborations similar to this can enhance the design, creation, development, and assessment of technical communication materials in patient education settings to help improve the odds that patients will understand more about their health and be able to make better decisions and can contribute valuable information to the technical communication curriculum. Best practices in technical communication can inform user-centered design, development, and assessment of educational materials in a variety of settings.",,,,,,,,,,,28,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2016,63,4,,,,,365,374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Swarts, J","Swarts, Jason",,,New Modes of Help: Best Practices for Instructional Video,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: To examine instructional video as a vernacular form of technical communication serving readers unwilling to consult print documentation. Provide a set of best practices for creating and delivering video based on analysis of existing, highly-rated content on YouTube. Method: Assessment of a criterion-based (that is, software type) sample of 46 instructional videos stratified by user ratings. Inductive coding of shared within-group (that is, good,  average, poor rating) features, including genre conventions, rhetorical work, and communication design qualities. Results: Good instructional videos share qualities that appear to account for their strong user ratings and distinguish them from average and poor videos. Good videos spend significant time introducing an instructional agenda and forecasting goals and steps. In this manner, they function like video equivalents of printed documentation. Good videos also focus on demonstrative content, in which steps are both performed and explained or elaborated. By contrast, videos with lower ratings focus as much or more on simply doing the steps without explaining or explaining without doing. Good videos were also designed so that their instructional messages could be easily identified and accessed, easily understood and applied, and so that the messages were engaging and encouraging. Conclusions: Designers of instructional video can successfully apply lessons learned from the design of instructional content for print while taking into account the medium-specific affordances and constraints of video and sound. The potential for rapid, viral distribution via social media channels should also inform the selection and design of instructional content.",,,,,,,,,,,20,33,33,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2012,59,3,,,,,195,206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Wagner, C; Schroeder, A","Wagner, Christian; Schroeder, Andreas",,,Capabilities and Roles of Enterprise Wikis in Organizational Communication,TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose: The article alerts technical communicators to wiki technology, an emerging new medium that allows dispersed groups to create shared content via collaborative editing and different-time communication. Wiki-based collaborative content creation enables new communication practices and thereby challenges several assumptions of existing media choice theories. Method: Analysis of empirical evidence from 32 published case descriptions and reports to evaluate wiki technology in a corporate context based on the defining characteristics of three media choice theories (i.e., media richness theory, theory of media synchronicity, and common ground theory). Results: Wikis meet or exceed capabilities of several other communication and collaboration media, and thus provide a credible alternative to other business communication technologies currently in use. Further, distinct media capabilities of wikis are not fully represented by current media choice theories, suggesting the need to extend media choice theories to recognize these unique capabilities. Conclusion: The unique features of enterprise wikis enable new collaboration practices and challenge some of the core theoretical assumptions of media choice theories. The refactoring capability of wikis is identified as a unique feature that enables new forms of collaboration and communication in organizations. An implementation that wishes to successfully leverage wiki-enabled collaboration opportunities must carefully consider challenges of human interaction such as free-riding, or conflict of values.",,,,,,,,,,,85,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2010,57,1,,,,,68,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
